hi.
i had been using mundobeat as my metronome in windows
and ever since migrating to linux i have been unable
to find a comparable metronome.

cane anyone help me find one for linux.
thanks

Has anyone successfully used a pci-pcmcia converter to let them use cardbus 
sound via pci?  I've got a vxpocket, and I certainly can't afford to shell out 
$2-300 for another soundcard.  Would using a converter be a suitable solution?
Thanks

I'm not familiar with mundobeat, but I really like RhythmLab.

If you are interested in a modular metronome, RTMix has a metronome
whose meter and tempo can be continuously adjusted in the performance
settings via preset script file, as well as utilizing real-time (MIDI)
triggers. It can also show groupings of beats as a separate "rows of
beats". For more info and screenshots see:

(docs)
http://meowing.ccm.uc.edu/~ico/RTMix-doc/

(metro screenshots -- the window/LED's are resizable, although that is
not obvious from the given screenshots)
http://meowing.ccm.uc.edu/~ico/RTMix-doc/3.html#3.6.4

(and finally more general screenshots)
http://meowing.ccm.uc.edu/~ico/RTMix-doc/7.html#7.3

Note: RTMix does not generate beat sound by default, but it can be
programmed to do so via script file. It's primary means of showcasing
beats is via visual "led" displays.

FWIW I am running RME's hdsp that way and it's heck of a lot cheaper
than buying RME's "certified" hdsp PCI card (mine cost ~$100 for a

Sorry, this was a bad pun on the word normal.  I don't
have any trouble 'normalizing' my files, I was just
making a joke using the word 'normal' in it's electronic

Hi,

I am using the 2.5.73 kernel, and ALSA works great
built in, using the proper config options.  Now I
have a need for jackd support, and so I'm guessing
that I will have to go back to the tarball distro
in order to give the --with-jack option to the configure
script.

With the 2.4.x kernels, the instructions were to
select "sound card support" (soundcore) and nothing
else.  Would that be the same as checking ALSA support
in the kernel with no other options?


Thanks,

Tobiah




-->><<--__-->><<--

hi,

i'm not sure if i understand you correctly, but if you are
talking about the alsa tarball and the --with-jack option of
the alsa config: this is not necesary to run jack. the
--with-jack option of alsa applies to building the pcm_jack
plugin, to use alsa native applications as jack clients
(which works only half btw), and does only apply to alsa-lib

Hey folks,

I'm considering building a Linux DAW and have a few questions.  First
of all I have a Delta 1010LT soundcard.  Does anyone have experience
with using that card on Linux?  Any caveats I should know about?

Secondly, I think I've narrowed down my mobo/CPU combination and
wonder if there's anything to watch out for there.  Here it is:

CPU: AMD Athlon XP 2400 Thoroughbred 2.0 Ghz 266Mhz FSB
Mobo: Asus A7N8X Deluxe NVIDIA nForce2 SPP, nForce2 MCP-T chipsets

Also, related to hardware, there seems to be a myriad of hard disk
choices out there.  The mobo seems to have built in support for
standard ATA IDE and SATA.  I haven't read the manual yet to find out
the details, but I'm thinking about going the older ATA100, 7200RPM
route since the drives are about half the price.  Am I shooting
myself in the foot by doing this?  Should I buy a PCI IDE controller
or is it possible to get reasonable results from the onboard
controller?  What are some drives you have had success (or failure)
with?

Finally, I would like to be able to record in remote locations
without having to bring along a monitor, keyboard, mouse, etc.  I was
thinking about using my laptop to open a remote X session on the main
box.  Is that a practical scenario or would that drain too many
resources on the main box to be productive?

This is mainly an experimental project.  I don't need this box for
everyday professional use or anything.  I'm just trying to build a
Linux box on a shoestring and hopefully get it to work with the audio
stuff.  I'm really trying to keep costs down to around $400 US --
pipe dream maybe, but we'll see.

Thanks,
Greg

I've been looking into similar systems. But, some of my colleagues have
steered me away from nvidia chipsets because they've heard nvidia has
not been nice about the drivers or something ... I don't really
understand the situation. Can someone confirm, deny or elaborate on the
status of nvidia chipset drivers?

Thanks,
Eric Rz.



-->><<--__-->><<--

I guess that issue is directly related to Linux support for the
chipset?  RME has quite a bit of information on using this board with
the Athlon XP on their site.  I guess their recommendations apply to
Windows users.

If not NVIDIA, then what?  VIA is bad too, right?

Greg






-->><<--__-->><<--


I don't really know. I've only heard rumours. I thought (hoped) VIA was
ok...




-->><<--__-->><<--
	I'm running on an AZZA KT3AV KT133A Socket A motherboard (266FSB, VIA
chipset), an AMD Athlon XP 1700+ 1.47GHz processor, 512MB PC133 memory,
a pair of ATA 100 IDE hard drives, an NVIDIA TNT2 32MB AGP video card,
and an ST Audio (Hoontech) C-Port DSP2000 system.  The DSP 2000 uses the
same chipset as the 1010LT but with an external ADC/DAC.  I haven't had
any problems with the IDE drives since I tuned them.  I've got
instructions for tuning them on my site -
http://myweb.cableone.net/eviltwin69/ALSA_JACK_ARDOUR.html.

	It's interesting that you should mention doing the remote X session
because I just did that recently and did some experimenting with it. 
First I tried running the X session over wireless LAN.  This was a
massive pain.  There's not enough bandwidth to handle the session so the
UI becomes very jerky.  Then I switched to hardwired 100Mb ethernet. 
What's really interesting is that I could run better remotely than I
could locally since all of the display overhead (X server) was taken off
of the recording workstation.  I actually started reducing my JACK
period size down and watched for when I would get xruns using the exact
same setup locally and remotely.  I started getting xruns much sooner
when I ran locally.

	BTW, one of the really nice things about the 1010LT, 1010, EWS88MT, and
the DSP 2000 (or any other card using the envy24 chipset) is that you
can set your JACK period size to a large value to avoid xruns since you
can monitor using the built-in digital mixer.

Yeah.  This part of an _ongoing_ flame war (which I don't wish to
continue here), mostly regarding binary-only policies and developer
support, etc.  Here's the latest installment (from today) by way of
example, a disccusion of ATI which bleeds periodically into NVIDIA
frustration/happiness:

http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/06/30/123225&mode=thread&tid=137&tid=152&tid=185

In my own experience, Nvidia chips/drivers work great on Linux,
contrary to my experiences with both ATI and Matrox cards.

Running dual-headed works fine for you with linux and linux audio apps? 

I've toyed with the idea of doing that with my next box ... but, have
shied away out of fear of the unknown.




-->><<--__-->><<--


The fastest, easiest, and most reliable options are:
RedHat with Planet CCRMA apt interface to the rpms - or - Mandrake.
Anything else is a fair bit more work for very little return.

If you chose Mandrake, keep in mind that most sound applications are in the 
'contrib' repositories, like mandrake.redbox.cz/Mandrake/9.1/contrib, so 
you'll have to tell urpmi or rpmdrake to look there.  There are also some apps 
at plf.zarb.org that cannot be included in Mandrake for legal reasons.

Let me know if you have any problems, as I'm starting to get things ready for 
Mandrake 9.2...

My suggestion would be to go for 2 small hardisks rather than one large
for 2 reasons. 1) The big hds get to hot to put acoustic padding
thingy's on them. 2) a seperate hard disk for audio means less chance of
latency problems from the system disk thrashing.

Don't get western digital caviers they will drive you mad with the
racket.

If your going to have mikes in the same room as the computer be prepared
to spend a lot of money on silent psu, fans, acoustic padding etc

Use the onboard controller. I'd stick with ata 100 as it's better tested
and the extra speed you get from sata isn't usefull for recording sound
(though obviously a faster computers allways nicer too use:)

And at the staudio.com there's lots of info on the via chipset having
problems with these low latency cards. Their cards the DSP24 are ICE1712 based,
for what is worth. Havent checked at the m-audio.

My setup is an AthlonXP1600+ nForce chipset and was working ok with DMA enabled
disks (ATA100 or ATA133, not sure). C-pot2000 DSP24.

ST Audio is the only really good source of fixes for the VIA
"problems".  M Audio has nothing on the subject and when I asked them
about it they were apparently unaware that there were any problems.  The
Delta 1010, 1010LT, 2496, Terratec EWS88MT, and all of the ST Audio
DSP24 cards are envy24 (ice1712 driver) chipset cards.  If you're going
to use a motherboard with the VIA chipset (as I do) you need to check
out ST Audio's pages.

Seagate barracudda IV's are quiet. They run quite hot, but dont need

I am running a Matrox Milennium G550 DualHead video card in my DAW, and

If you are an experienced Linux user, I would personally suggest Slackware 
9. You have to configure most things by hand, but the distro itself is very 
lean and tweakable, and gives very good performance for audio. Another nice 
thing is that the kernel is the vanilla source from kernel.org so patching 
it for low latency and preempt is no problem at all.

You would also be able to grab prepared packages from my site at

No, I want it now :)
@comix: Is there a schedule, when your jack transport moves into CVS? 
I'd really like to learn from that.

Jack's CVS does not include the proposed transport API by Jack O'Quin 
yet, only the soon to be deprecated jack_set/get_transport_info functions.

Is there a kind of testbed for jack's transport API proposal?
It is supposed to be the precondition for ardour's 1.0-release. The 
sooner other apps incorporate it, the better, I think.

Thanks for your suggestions.  This probably won't be too much of an
issue for me b/c I won't be often recording in the same room as the
computer, I have a *far from silent* recording environment, and I
typically don't use good enough mics for the extra noise to matter
much anyway.

Hello Jason,

Could you elaborate on what you have tried, did you use ALSA, if so which 
version, what config-tricks have you tried?

I've got a Audigy with LiveDrive, I haven't used the midi-port, but I did have 
a stab at getting the remote control to work, and indeed it did, but it was 
far from obvious. As far as I can tell the remote-control uses a midi-port 
for it's data so I may be able to help.

It was a while though so I can't remember exactly what it was that should be 
done...
You may also try the alsa-user mailinglist.

I did try a few months back to enable the audio-input on the LiveDrive also, 
but I had no success with that, it may have improved though...

Robert

hi,
assuming you are using ALSA (www.alsa-project.org), there is a known

the alsa list (http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/) also has a link
about the Driver Status, go check it out. amongs other things it
says: "- MPU401 - implemented - should work but not tested".

i have only a SB Live myself, successfully use a gameport-to-midi

Hello,

A collegue of mine just bought the new Radio Head CD, Hail To The Thief.
As the box says, this CD is "Copy Controlled". Some searching on the web
revealed that it using so called Cactus Data Shield 200 protected, which
means deliberate errors on the cd, that most (not all!) CD players deal
with correctly, but cd-rom readers don't. So, what if you want to play
your "CD" on a computer. Well, the CD also includes a data track, with a
MS Windows (yeah..) application. However! This application does not play
the CD audio but a compressed format also included on the CD! Another
interesting issue is that the fake errors might actually cause problems 
when some real errors occur on the CD, that normally would have been 
corrected, but not anymore in combination with the fake errors.

Obviously, all this is completely unacceptable, so I advice you to never
buy a Copy Controlled CD. If you have bought one, bring it back to the
store. They have absolutely no reason not to give you your money back.

(From the web: 'Philips controls the CD standard and their spokesman
says: "Any changes that put a disc outside the CD standard result in a
disc that should no longer be described or marketed as a CD." Philips,
because of conformity issues,   has warned the record labels that the
discs are actually not compact discs at all, and must bear warning
labels to inform consumers.'). I'd add that stores should then not be
allowed to sell these CD's in a part of the store that says "Compact
Discs"

Not that I did manage to play the CD with Linux. My very old (>6 years)
SCSI cd writer has been able to read the copy protected CD with
cdparanoia. but... in the left channel, every 5.8 sec some values are
distorted: about 10 groups of 1 to 3 samples in a row get an extreme
value (not always the same, but near maximum). I wrote a small
application that corrects those distorted values (linear interpolation
with the surrounding samples). I assume this information is legal,
because it is only to play the cd, not to copy it.

 Audigy 2 support is now added in the SourceForge EMU10K1 code.=20

I have no idea if these drivers are synced with the alsa-stuff
but anyway it should be worth a try. Since they come from
Creative directly chances are that they support more features
than alsa's.

Huh.  I bought the US "Limited Edition", it didn't mention "copy controlled" 
anywhere on the packaging, I threw it in the drive and immediately ripped it 
without trouble using RipperX (without "paranoid" mode or whatever turned on, 
even.)

Wonderful CD incidentally, the pre-release copy I got months ago must have 
been remixed or something before release because the final version really 
sparkles.  I'd never recommend anyone buy a so-called "copy controlled" CD by 
any artist though.  They might as well have a sticker on the front that says 
"Don't buy me, pirate me instead!" on those discs.

I recently bought the Live NIN CD and was disappointed to find that it
might be copy protected as well.  It's not on the list of copy protected
CDs and it bears no warning, but it also doesn't have the "Compact Disc
Digital Audio" logo anywhere on it.  On top of all that, ripping
applications have been weird when pulling audio off of it.  cdparanoia
managed to start getting the tracks this morning, but it was going very
slow with lots of errors being noted.  I'll be interested in hearing if
it works or not...

annoyed by the fact that the warning was on the inside rather than 
the outside that I decided to give it a go in Grip and make some 
copies with XCDRoast and K3b. In particular I'm annoyed that they're 
departing from the CD standard and messing around with error 
correction.

It ripped and duplicated with no problems whatsoever, which leaves me 
with three theories:

1. The warning is a bluff

or

2. Some CDs were pressed with the anti-copy technology, others weren't

or

3.  They were going to press the CD with Cactus or whatever (when the 
booklet copy was written) but changed their minds for some reason.

I hope it's 3.

I've written an article on DRM for Sound on Sound, including some 
stuff on Cactus Data Shield, which should hopefully be in the August 
issue.  

Since I wrote that article, an interesting example came my way - 
apparently, radio stations that use PC based playlist systems just 
throw Cactus discs in the bin. If it won't rip at full quality - it 
can't get played on air.

Cheers

Newspaper articles I saw here in the US indicated that some manufacturers
were making a large number of non-protected disks, and then a smaller number
of protected disks, and then mixing them together for shipment. None of the
disks were externally marked in any way to identify which ones were which.

The strategy, apparently, was to let people return the protected disks them
as bad disks, if they found them, and then let the retail stores return them
to the manufacturer. The manufacturer would then take statistics about how
many of the protected disks were returned, and would then use this info to
make a decision about how many more disks they could afford to make
protected. their goal was to get the number of protected disks way up over
time.

As always, I'm the rat in the maze. I now attempt to rip EVERY CD I buy,
even though I do not usually play CDs on my computer and don't even keep the
ripped track. Such a waste of time.

Unlike many, I don't understand the attraction of downloaded music, really,
other than it's theft. I completely disagree with both copy protecting CD as
I should be able to make a personal copy, but I completely disagree with
Kazaa, et all, as it's just theft.

I guess I'm just disagreeable... ;-)

Isn't that nearly every commercial radio station in the US?

I know that a lot of radio stations don't have nighttime DJs anymore...
they just record a bit of blather and program the setlist into
the computer.


hmm, there must be more to the story. Maybe non-protected copies
are sent to radio now.

Ouch! That should hit the jerks where it hurts.

Anyway, I can't see what's to stop a pirate duplicator playing the copy
protected CD in a good player (with error correction or interpolation,
or whatever these things rely on) and re-digitising it and running their
pirate copies from that, if that's what they really want to do. In
otherwords a good old fashioned analog copy. The music merchants
obviously aren't bothered about ultimate quality, are they? Neither are 
the MP3 swappers.

Like an earlier poster, I am opposed to copy protection but also opposed
to theft of music that's supposed to be for sale. I see no paradox here.
I assume there are many music makers (as opposed to just consumers) on
this list who are on the side of the music producers while at the same
time (being Linux users) appreciating the absence of restrictive
practices or sales contracts.

BBC 7 played two streams mixed together the other day and no-one there 
noticed for 20 minutes...


I expect that's the case with radio promo CDs, but as it's been 
noticed, the various kinds of copy-protected CDs are often 
mislabelled or are released in mixed batches. Not every label 
produces a radio-only version of the CD - maybe they'll have to in 
future.

One of the hypocrisies of the RIAA et al is they actually do believe 
in giving away free music - when it suits them, even at considerable 
expense to the labels. Anyone reviewing or playing music for a living 
gets bombarded with thousands of free CDs, of which most go direct to 
the second-hand store.

I don't think copyright law makes much of a distinction. Fair use 
doesn't seem to carry much weight these days...

As for the emotive word 'theft', I think you're confusing bits with 
atoms. You can't steal a binary number - and with p2p, you're not 
even 'stealing' bandwidth from the artist.

The industry has deliberately confused the two - comparing p2p users 
with shoplifters, for example. If someone gets busted for 
shoplifting, it's not because of copyright infringement - it's 
because of theft of physical property, or atoms.

Just suppose you hear a song on the radio - are you stealing it, if 
you later choose not to by the CD? I bet there are lots of people 
listening to the radio right now, who have no intention of buying the 
music they are hearing. It's absurd to imagine that you could extract 
payment from each and every listener in the analogue domain, so why 
should the labels expect to do this in the digital one? Because 
they've been sold DRM snake oil, I expect.

Or what if you don't listen to the advertisers who pay the radio 
station's music royalties bill? Are you willfully interfering with a 
business model? That sort of behaviour can get you into trouble these 
days...

Cheers

-->><<--__-->><<--

I think - morally speaking - it depends what's on offer. If the major 
labels intend to use DRM to the extent that it gives them an even 
tighter grip on the distribution of human culture, then I for one 
won't be upset if that system gets broken.

There's that 'theft' word again. It reminds me of the story of Sanji 
and the Baker - a children's book. Sanji is found guilty of smelling 
bread and cakes without paying, an aroma that rises each morning from 
the baker's shop beneath his apartment. The wise old judge awards the 
baker the right to hear the sound of Sanji's money as it drops into a 
bowl - clink, clink! - not the money itself.

If you're talking about musicians getting paid properly - a decent, 
sustainable income that's proportional to their effort and talent - 
then I couldn't agree more. However, the music business doesn't have 
a great history on that front...

Cheers

While I understand your point of view, I will disagree and then go silent on
the topic. I've been in enough conversations with folks who have the
opposite point of view from me to know that neither of us will change each
other's minds. That's OK. I agree to be the loser and let you be the winner
in public. I won't lose a bit of sleep over it.

In your binary number example above, if the license between the artist and
the label/CD manufacturer says that the numbers can only be delivered to an
end customer on a CD, then the end customer buys the CD, at which point I
think you and I agree that fair use would allow the end customer to rip the
CD and use it for his own personal, private use in whatever format he wants.
Neither you nor I are going to care if he really plays the CD or the mp3 at
home. That's his private freedom. He should be able to make backup CDs, put
them offsite to guard against a fire killing his collection. He should be
able to play the CD creating the actual audio, and he should be able to play
it on one player at a time, anywhere he wants. All of that is OK. I'm pretty
sure we agree with that.

The problem with this whole mp3/kazaa thing is that it enable playing
multiple copies at the same time by different people in multiple locations
all for the price of one CD. While you may not like it, I'm sure you can see
that at the cost of building a studio, recording the band, manufacturing the
CD, getting radio play, etc., there are a lot of people in the process and a
lot of hardware dollars that get used up. Taking the Kazaa thing to the
extreme, there will be exactly one CD sold, and then copies will be given to
everyone in the world for free to use whatever way they want, but none of
the dollars that were used to make the CD or the studio or to pay the band
are ever recovered and as a business it all just fails.

In my mind, using something I didn't pay for, or didn't pay the money to the
real owner, just isn't right. Theft is one word for this if you actively
seek out this property. Accepting stolen goods might be another term if
someone just gives it to me. In any case, I chose to take responsibility for
my actions. I hope others will to. I listen on the radio. I listen on
mp3.com. I listen on Radiohead's web site. Then, if I like it, I buy it. Old
fashioned, 'eh? ;-)


Spoken like a true 'Open Sourcer'! If you want your code to be licensed a
certain way, that's you're right. If they want their code to be licensed a
different way, that's their right. Hopefully the courts will protect the
both of you. Hopefully it will prosecute those who harm the both of you.

I think we could offer a perspective that says GPL code should only be
protected if it's delivered on paper? If it's delivered over the internet,
and then used in any way the person who has it wants it, then that's fair,
right? ;-)


The radio station pays a royalty to the label for the right to play the
music. I think this example doesn't exactly address the issue at hand, but
maybe I'm missing the point. True, a user can tape the radio, and with
digital satellite radio, if you can record the digital stream, then
presumably the quality could be quite good. I think you cannot record that
though. (DRM again)



Yep. Tivo and others are basically out of business on this point...

Great ideas Daniel. Thanks for the opportunity to discuss them.

Hmmm, now I'm extra interested in going home this evening and seeing if
the rip finished successfully ::-).  I know it wasn't Cactus that was
used on my audio disc - I actually thought of that and tried to mount
it, but couldn't find an iso9660 filesystem.  And just in case it was
buried in some weird session, I had cdrdao extract the TOC and verify
the layout was consistent.  Just one session of audio.

Everything on that CD was correct, except Q Sub channel CRC codes.

If that indeed is some kind of copy protection, it's absolutely the
worst idea I've ever heard of, since that data is used to error
correcting data on a CD (see semi-recent thread on CD error correction
for more info).  I'll bet one scratch turns that sucker into a
coaster...

(Which ironically, makes me want to be able to burn backups more than
ever!)

Agreed.  My favorite analogy is this:

Suppose that a thief breaks into my home and steals one CD.
Since Radiohead sparked this discussion, let's say it's my Radiohead 
"The Bends" CD which I happen to have in front of me at the moment,
and which was released by Capitol, and which I purchased at retail 
price.

Does Capitol have a right to prosecute the thief?
Does Radiohead have a right to prosecute the thief?


hmm. Actually, commercial radio attempts to do this, in a funny way,
through the licensing fees that are paid to BMI, ASCAP et al. 


We're basically revisiting the radio wars, which produced the 
license fee business model for radio. There will be floundering
until somebody comes up with a new business model that the record companies
can live with (or until they go extinct, I suppose).
Personally I think that copy-protected media is doomed to fail.

Neither for that action. The crime was against you, and you insurance
company if you have theft insurance. You bought the right to use that CD.
The thief has denied you of your right to do so. You get to prosecute the
thief if you choose to. At this point the thief has not wronged the record
label as they have been paid for the CD copy.

These discussions always seems to come down to sort of strange examples. If
the thief did this, would you call Capitol Records? Of course you wouldn't.
Capitol Records has no jurisdiction in your house.

Should the thief take the CD, rip a few mp3's and start providing them on
the internet, Capitol Records could call the police and ask for their day in
court. It would be an interesting question that if you did NOT call the
police when this theft happened, and then the thief did this rip and release
process, would you be liable along with the thief as you did not take all
appropriate actions to protect yourself and your property? I think possibly
yes.... (Ugly!) ;-)

	Just had to put my 2 cents in here.  So, I go and buy the CD - it won't
rip or play on my computer - I slap it in my decent CD player (with
analog outs to my DSP2000) - I record it at 16/44.1 - I encode it in ogg
- I post that on the web somewhere.  Now, question for the student, how
much worse is my ogg copy than a ripped and encoded ogg copy?  If you're
willing to settle for mp3 then this is just as acceptable and it can't
be stopped.  From what I gather from most of my reading up on sound
cards, most of them go from digital to analog and then back when you rip
anyway.  Is the connection from your cd player to your sound card
digital?  It is on my system but I don't think it is on most of the
cheaper ones.

	All this type of copy protection does is to give you a crappy CD to
start with.  Your best bet is to write a long lovely fan letter to the
band telling them that you won't buy anymore garbage - especially not at
US $17.99.

	BTW, the above was just an example.  I agree with Mark K.  I don't
download any music that isn't free and legal.

Hi,


Yes, ardour stops hydrogen, but does not start it, since

- ardour(0.9beta1) does not send DEFERRED PLAY
- libhydrogen does not call startPlay()

when they are supposed to do so.
But, quite easy hack to get them there. Though, I still had to adjust 
the recorded track in ardour, which is definitely not what I want. But 
wait....

Absolutely cool. It works like a charm. Forget about MMC, MTC.

Jan,
   Always good to hear from another country!


Yep, you are mostly right. The quality can be quite good, presuming you're
using studio quality hardware. Hell, you can send it out of your D/A and
then bring it right back in live through your A/D and you're still
completely digital.

The digital quality will be studio quality if you use studio quality
hardware.


Mostly true, although Macrovision makes some form of copy protection that
can get embedded in the digital data stream which is supposed to survive
becoming analog. There was also discussion of making D/A converters that
would refuse to convert if this DRM data was in the data stream.


It's digital on all my systems these days, and it's digital on most new
portables, I believe...


I don't think it's the band that's doing this. It's the labels that have
invested money in the band, and it's the big distribution companies.


I think that most people that make music don't do too much of this. I
download music legally, from mp3.com, or one of these days from iTunes for
$0.99/tune. Most of this p2p is a simple market driven reaction to the fact
that most CD's these days have only 1-2 tunes that make the money. Most of
the rest of the CD is filler. (Well, in Madonna's recent CD I think it's all
filler!) ;-) No one I know wants to pay $8.00/'good song', and then get the
other 10 songs for free? $0.99 for the songs a person like sounds like a
good deal. I generally would still buy CDs as 'Snow' by Spocks Beard would
be pointless purchasing a single song, but I might by a Michelle Branch tune
that I liked and she'd make a few cents from me she'd never get any other
way...





-->><<--__-->><<--

	In order to embed DRM in analog you would have to be able to put
content into the analog that would be either above or below the range of
human hearing or it would be audible.  The bottom line - if I can hear
it, I can steal it.



	The bands have more say than you think, especially big name bands.


	Check out http://www.mp3.com/bluesbakers.  ;-)

-->><<--__-->><<--

In other words, it screws up the audio. Nice. :-(


Yes, but label execs don't generally give two shits about the fans as long
as sales are up.  They *do* give a shit, out of necessity, about 
accommodating their top bands. So I think a letter-writing campaign to the
bands in question is more likely to have an effect.


yep... I download maybe a handful of songs a year, usually things that I don't
even like enough to burn to CD; occasionally things that I'm curious about that
I would buy if I could find the damn things.


This is very true. There's a bunch of great pop songs that come on crap
albums... "Genie in a Bottle" leaps to mind...


Yep. Pop music kind of wants to be a singles market, but the CD era killed
most of the economic incentive for selling singles because there's barely
any difference in the manufacturing / distribution cost of CDs regardless of
length - only quantity really matters.

BTW, it's now possible to set up cheap per-song paid downloads on your own
website without a lot of cost overhead and without a time-based 
subscription service.  Check these guys out, they've just launched and 
I'm very curious to see if they succeed:

This is what the RIAA refers to as the "analog hole".  They're looking
for ways to stop you from doing just that.  It's not technically

The other evening, when everyone was home from work, Christy asked if I knew who it was that was playing the song she liked on the radio that I had on.  I told her to go to www.kfog.com and it will say what is currently playing on their web site.

This is a common thing now, to hear something, and if we find the name of the band;  to then go look for mp3s on the net of other songs by the same group.  If we like the music and feel like listening to it again, we always go out and buy the CDs.

We value the quality of the sound we listen to around here, and the compressed stuff on the net isn't really that good anyway.  I am getting very concerned about the copy protection in CDs, where they will only play in commercial audio CD players with error correction.  I feel like someone is trying to blur what I am able to see out of my windows, because they are worried that I might take a picture.  My fear is that some of these CDs may be easily turned into junk by a little mishandling?

As an aside.

Most of our CD decks have digital outputs that we then connect to the amps.  And most of our sound cards in our computers have digital ins.  Am I missing something here?

Well, look at typical music industry practice in dealing with musicians. Most 
of the time, the creative talent gets ripped off (not paid) by the record 
company. Then by the above rule, buying a "legitimate record company" CD is 
"accepting stolen goods". So there is no morally correct way to hear "music 
industry product" recordings. Maybe everyone should go back to making their 
own music, live, at least until the RIAA cartel withers away. Or at least 
keeps the ownership of the recordings out of the hands of those crooks.

OK, OK, mostly off-topic, but not completely...





-->><<--__-->><<--

Yes.  Those CDs are damaged goods.  They won't play on your computer. 
They also, usually, won't play on your CD player with digital outs.  If
the RIAA has anything to say about it DRM will be built in to all
players with digital outs so that you will not get anything
comprehensible out of the digital outs.  But, as I said before, if you
can hear it, you can copy/steal it, so these efforts are for naught. 
They just cost you more money for less product.  Boycott all copy
protected CDs and return any that you mistakenly buy (as is your
right).  That's the only way to deal with it.

There wasn't anything realy novel in there which is why I zapped it.

Mostly the observation that I know somewhere thats chucking out 1.4 ghz
pcs with cdwriters and ok soundcards, which, with LAD s/w and a bit of
mains power is basicly all you need to make some kinds of music.

Some would say not very good kinds ;) but there was still a time when you
were dependent on labels for funding to produce practically anything with
decent production values.

-->><<--__-->><<--
Right, and basically except for Kid Rock, the only stuff being signed is
teeny bopper crap, or Celine Dion rip offs, none of that music is even
worth stealing, much less buying. Even a Kid Rock is just uncreative,
neandertalic and totally uncreative. As a creative artist I know I have no
hope of making it here, but I used to think I could work tech jobs and use
the programming experience to help my music, but now that I've been pushed
out of the tech industry I don't know what I'm going to do, but I know I
haven't been able to fit in as an artist, and now I don't even fit in as a
bloody worker, so basically next February (when my unemployment runs
out) I get to find out how I'm going to continue as an electronic composer
while living out on the streets of la.








-->><<--__-->><<--
They would actually have to force us all to have coclier implants in the
inner ear that could shut down our hearing if perhaps a subaudible signal
that would "unlock" the music is missing. So, pirate mp3s and they'll pull
a switch to take away your hearing for the rest of your life.








-->><<--__-->><<--
Plus with all the great, creative sounds being made by the members of this
list alone, there's absolutely no reason to buy major record label
product. I can find higher quality music being given away by the artist
for free than its possible to find in all the archives of major labels
(well, ok Hendrix is major label, but look, they assainated him).








-->><<--__-->><<--

Ah, maybe that's why my glasses keep fogging up when I try to read the 
documentation to my MP3 player :-)

Can you truly say that you like *nothing* being signed and recorded 
today? Sure, there's a lot of teen pop and plastic divas, but if you 
think that's *all* that's out there, you've stopped paying attention. 
You might wander into a record store and take a look around.

Over the past day, I've listened to, among other disks stacks on top of 
my monitor, Terry Riley, Sigur Ros, Jaco Pastorius, Patti Smith, James 
Blood Ulmer, John Zorn, and Kodo. All of these were purchased at major 
chain record stores. Please let us know which you consider to be "teeny 
bopper crap"; what remains would be what you consider "Celine Dion ripoffs".

What we may be seeing here is an instance of the fallacy of nostalgia: 
sure, to reference Theodore Sturgeon, 90% of everything is crap, but 90% 
of everything always *has* been crap. Most of the older stuff has just 
been forgotten.

Because you knew what you were looking for? I don't think there's a 
lack of CDs out there - its easier to make one than ever. But those 
CDs just won't get the marketing of the mainstream stuff.

I think there's always been a two-tier music audience, one listener 
driven, one marketing driven. The problem is that the marketing 
driven stuff is so pervasive that it crowds out the rest, even though 
we have so many more ways to listen now.

There was a live debate on this very issue last night on BBC Radio 2. 
Indie labels complained that when they take a new release to the 
radio stations (in the UK) the station management is more interested 
in the marketing 'plot' than hearing the music. In other words, if 
your song has got money behind it, it will get on the radio.

I suppose the problem (as in so many other fields) is that we've 
allowed the accountants and lawyers to take over from the people who 
really care about what they do for a living. 


Maybe.


This might explain why so much music around in the UK at the moment is 
derivative. If you know your music (either because like me, you own a 
turntable and have lots of old vinyl, or because like everyone else I 
know, you use Kazaa a lot) you can pinpoint the exact source of a 
riff, or a vocal. Not samples, but pale imitations. I guess most 
people can't, otherwise they'd be buying the original instead.

I loved the Pixies, but there's a lot of bands at the moment who 
imitate them so closely that they may as well be a tribute band. But 
since tribute bands are very popular in pubs and clubs these days, 
maybe that's the reason.

Well, I was quite surprised by the thread that followed my initial mail
about the copy protected CD's. I have had a lot of thoughts about it,
but especially this comment by Brian Redfern triggered my imagination:


I'd like to agree, but personally, I have a hard time finding good music
for free. There is also a lot of, how shall i put it, lesser quality
music around, and I don't really know where to look. I find it already
very difficult to find something that I really like among known music or
publicly advertised/broadcasted music. How do you go to a record store
and pick a CD of an artist you don't know yet? By the cover?

When I listen to new music (new as in new to me, not in age) it's
because friends whose musical taste i value tell me about it. Something
else I do is consulting www.allmusic.com, and follow the
related-artists/followers/influences links, and listen to the stuff with
high ratings. In theory, this method is okay, but I have found myself
more than once disagreeing with the ratings and sometimes even with the
related-artist linking.

Now, what I would really like, is a website dedicated to free music,
that offers a search engine not unlike allmusic, but much more
"intelligent": keeping user profiles, matching user profiles with tastes
so it can make suggestions, an advanced rating system where users can
rate not only the music itself but also similarity to other artists,
etc. (RFC)

Everybody has a different taste (well actually, a lot of people have the
same taste: none ;-), but i am sure some people have a taste similar to
mine. I'd like a computer system to find that out, and decide who my
"virtual" friend are that "tell" me about new music. Of course, it
should also include the obvious: Free mp3 downloads, links to the
artists, a way to donate money to the artists, and maybe even a peer to
peer network that only contains this free music.

Where is this website ? :-)

Heh, yeah. Agreed. I listend to an MTV dance music nostalgia show last
night, from a year when I remmembered it was all great. In retrospect - it
sucked.

There is a story that a british political comic, punch
(http://www.punch.co.uk) carried a letter its 1842 edition (the 2nd)
saying that punch was "not as good as it used to be", people have been
saying that ever since. It became the motto.

Sure, but thats just because new models of recommendation haven't been
worked out enough. Things like mp3.com one way of finding good,
unpublished bands, but to me its not that useful as it appears the the
public actually likes the bulk pop fodder they get handed by the labels.
 

There have been a bunch of light-AI backed recommender websites (mostly
produced by university CS departments), I think they tend to fold because
the cost of running them is a bit too high. Maybe someone like MP3.com
could support it, now there getting bigger.

I've had a reasonable ammount of exposure through mp3.com, and even some
cash, even though my music is quite a ... specialised taste ;) But the
recommender algorithm they use is deeply b0rken and tends to cause a
positive feedback, rich get richer, effect.

No, I don't think you are. In which case the copy protection mechanism
is next to useless.

SCMS bits will be set to 'no copy', of course, but there's plenty
of sound cards with S/PDIF input that ignore the SCMS bits.

Feel free to change my mind! 


I think the problem for the general public here is one of perception 
and reality. They perceive that they own the music they have bought, 
rather than merely licence it. I guess the music business, along with 
book publishing, could have been the model for proprietary software 
licencing.


This could be a strength or a weakness, depending on how you look at 
it. The really big selling records - the only ones that the labels 
make decent money on - need to achieve a critical mass among 
listeners, either by radio or TV, or some other means. My theory is 
that the RIAA et al can see the value of p2p - it solves the problem 
of paying for large amounts of bandwidth inherent in the 
client/server model - but they want to preserve their 'right' to 
choose what people listen to. 

They've got the radio/TV thing pretty sewn up, then all of a sudden 
along comes this p2p thing and people want to buy - for example - 
Janis Ian CDs. That's not what the labels were pushing this year - 
and all the money they spent on hyping Maddona isn't going to be 
recouped in sales. The pattern for the major labels over the last few 
years has been - established artist/mega money multiple-album 
deal/sales OK but not brilliant/label panic. Look what happened to 
Mariah Carey, and could still happen to Robbie Williams.

Some artists you just can't drop, because your label would collapse. I 
think this is the only reason Michael Jackson and Madonna - cash cows 
in the past - still have record deals. It sure as hell isn't on the 
merit of their recent work. 

I think this is a consequence of the fact that global media is an 
expensive game to be in, and depending on an artist to deliver the 
goods at the right time is always going to be a gamble. Past earnings 
are no guarantee of future performance, as the small print on stock 
market deals says.
  

I run my own studio, albeit a small one, and it's a capital intensive 
business - for sure.


Unfortunately this is true even without Kazaa. That's why they have 
those big baskets of cheap CDs nobody wants in every record store. 
The fact is that in the old business model, you still had to give 
away a lot of free stuff to get your music heard. The difference is 
that now you don't have to make loss-leading singles, radio promos, 
etc etc. 

There are people with full time jobs at major record labels just 
giving away free stuff - called 'pluggers'. The cost of the old 
system is unfordable for a lot of musicians - godspeed you black 
emperor! pointed out that if each distributor in 20 countries demands 
500 free CDs for plugging, then the band pays for 10,000 CDs out of 
its own pocket before they make a penny. Within the industry, there's 
a culture of 'free beer' where people expect to get CDs, overseas 
trips, VIP tickets and so on before they'll even listen to the music. 

I think the way forward is for labels to radically cut their expenses 
by ending the free beer culture, cutting out all the middlemen and 
being honest with musicians about the money. I think the major labels 
can see this, but it's a road they don't want to go down. 


That seems only fair, on the surface. However, this begs several 
questions. Can you own a collection of compressed air, or a binary 
number? Who is the real owner of your culture? 

I'd probably side with the record industry on the question of payment, 
given the money it takes to record and distribute - rather than make 
- great music. However, the industry has an appalling record on both 
these points; making sure musicians get paid properly, and 
recognising their debt to the originators.

In particular, I have a problem on this latter point with the UK's 
rock aristocracy, who made most of their money from ripping off black 
American music and selling it to white Americans in a more acceptable 
format. So for Mick Jagger or Eric Clapton to say I owe *them* money 
because they own 'their' music, I find particularly distasteful.


Again, you're using phrases that originally related to things made of 
atoms. We wouldn't have had a musical tradition at all if music had 
always been treated as property. Don't forget that copyright was 
originally a bargain for short term exclusive distribution, not a 
permanent enclosure of human culture into a pay-per-listen 
'experience'.


Absolutely. My favoured business model - as a music lover - involves 
me asking to buy a CD direct from the artist. They'll keep about 9 
pounds on a ten pound CD, which even after recording and mastering is 
paid for, is a sufficient profit margin to make a living out of. If 
they don't want to deal with CD distribution, and concentrate on 
their music, I'd respect that - but so far no-one's turned me down...

If the band or artist becomes too famous to handle the volume of 
requests for CDs (which is only going to happen in a minority of 
cases), they'll have no trouble getting a distribution deal. The 
control of the career remains with the artist though.


The problem is that the old model requires artists to surrender their 
copyright to the label in order to (have the chance to) make a 
living. So it's not what the artist wants, it's how the label wants 
to licence 'their' property.


I'd rather the courts were used for real crimes, instead of defending 
an obsolete and unfair business model. Seeing as I don't claim 
exclusive ownership of my own culture, I'm not sure how I could 
justify sending someone to prison for 'stealing' it.


It's not about formats - it's about fundamental principles. 


Sure - but did the labels get together with Napster and work out a 
royalties model for copyrighted material on p2p? First Napster was 
sued, then it was bought out. So better p2p systems came along...

The labels have had 15 years to figure out the internet, and ten years 
to figure out the web. Frank Zappa even laid out the business model 
for music downloads (in his autobiography) even before the technology 
was available. That we've now reached the point where students are 
getting sued for their life savings - and in Australia, facing five 
years in prison - proves the industry just didn't want to change.

Hello everyone,

next week, on July 10th - 13th, the LinuxTag, Europe's largest GNU/Linux
exhibition and congress, takes place again in Karlsruhe, Germany, and
once again several LAD "members" will be there with a booth to
demonstrate what some of you/us have developed in the past :-).

I'd like to invite anyone to come along, say hello and have some tech
babble with us :-). We, that is:
- J=F6rn Nettingsmeier, your faithful mailing list adminstrator
- Julien Patrick Claassen, showing text-mode applications (Ecasound,
Csound etc)
- Matthias Nagorni of SuSE, author of AlsaModularSynth, KAConnect and
other tools and docs
- Takashi Iwai, one of the main authors of ALSA
- Josh Green from California, developer of the Swami soundfont editor
(once called Smurf)
- Conrad Parker from Australia, author of the Sweep sound editor - he
will also have a presentation of Sweep during the public congress.
- and yours truly.

Also, some developers of the Glame editor (Richard Guenther, Alexander
Ehlert, Daniel Kobras) will be there (probably on Saturday/Sunday), and
also Werner Schweer, author of the MusE MIDI sequencer, will be there at
least one day on the weekend.

As in the last 2 years, our main focus will be to bring some of the
really great sound apps to public attention, help with install problems,
spread information on ALSA and Jack, exchange knowledge amongst
ourselves, and of course also to have a good time - with a little chance
to actually make some music :-). But even if you'd not visit our booth
(shame on you!), the LinuxTag is a great place to be.

_IF_ you plan to come and don't want to spend a few Euros on the
entrance fee (yes, it's not completely free anymore since last year), be
smart and register at the LinuxTag's homepage which will result in a PDF
generated for you that you print out and take with out as entrance
ticket. It's even under the GPL :-). Weird concept, I know, but the idea
is not that stupid after all - at least this keeps some of the kiddies
away (those who visited former LinuxTag events know what I mean).

For any and all information regarding the place, travel, accomodation
and so on, please visit http://www.linuxtag.org. Unfortunately, the
booth planning is not finished yet, so I cannot say right now what our
booth number will be - but it shouldn't be hard to find. Officially on
the exhibitor list, we are named "Linux Audio".

Hope to see you there,
Frank

Hendrix is actually a great example. Far from unknown and then 
'discovered', as most people would have it, he was playing live for 
years but no-one in the industry would give him a break.

It took an outsider (and a musician, not a label executive) to 
recognise his talent, and introduce him to other UK-based musicians. 
It was on their insistence that he got the gig at Monterrey in 1967, 
which I think was his first big break in the US.

As for assassinated, I think it would be fairer to say that they 
didn't look after him very well. He actually died due to the 
combination of sleeping tablets and alcohol, shortly after playing a 
storming set in a field just outside our village to 600,000 people. 
He's kind of a religious figure around here...

The Real Frank Zappa Book, published 1989. Page 337 'A Proposal for a 
system to replace phonograph record merchandising'.

Re-reading it now, I'm amazed to notice that Zappa took this 
all-digital network music idea to Rothschild Venture Capital many 
years before the book was written, when CDs hadn't yet become 
generally available and a CD player cost $700. He begins with the 
limitations and business problems of vinyl distribution, and argues 
that CD won't really solve those problems.

The idea was that the digital music would come down the phone line or 
cable TV wire, where it could be transferred onto a Sony F1 tape 
machine (which I assume is an early form of DAT). Alternatively, a 
cheaper solution would use a DA converter and analogue cassette tape. 
It was proposed to do all the royalty accounting in software, with 
subscribers paying a flat monthly fee. The album artwork would be 
displayed on the cable TV channel.

Needless to say, the VCs turned Zappa down. But it proves that the 
ideas were there for the taking, probably twenty years ago.

Cheers

I think there will be opportunities in the crossover between the two. 
Most of the music industry appears to running on Mac OS 9 - that 
can't last forever.


That's commitment. I notice you don't say 'give up making music'.

I hope you find something that suits you.

Hi, is there anybody who knows about the existence of a Linux driver for
the Audiophile USB device by M-Audio? I want to buy this one since the 2
x more expensive Quattro is not affordable in my case (and neither need
that much audio in- and outputs), allthough a linux driver seems to
exist for the Quattro (written by...?). I mailed M-Audio and they simply
reply they do not support Linux for these devices. Only their Delta
cards are supported for Linux but the drivers are written by third party
developers. Maybe it is possible to modify the Quattro driver such that
it works with the Audiophile as well, but I'm not particularly a wizzkid
for these things.... Is there anybody who can help me find a solution?

thanks in advance,

Hallo,



You should search the alsa-(user|devel) mailing list archives for this
card (box?). If I remember it correctly, the USB Audiophile needs a
specific firmware loader that shouldn't be too hard to write but
hasn't been written yet. So I really would be careful with buying this
card at the moment. There are alternatives. For example the Edirol
UA-20 is very similar in price and functionality. There were some
problems with that some months ago, but I guess it should work now. 

If you need that card for a laptop, then just configure a generic 
snd-usb-audio card and take the laptop to your shop to try it out.

Hallo,


Hey, you are even lucky. Here in Germany almost every domestic CD by a
major label now has some kind of copy control. Normally I just don't
buy these, I even pay a higher price for the imported vinyl version. 

But then Paddy McAloon of Prefab Sprout made his first solo album
which is just unearthly beautiful and as a big PS fan I had to buy the
copy destroyed CD version because there is no vinyl one. I didn't
bother trying to rip it and put it straight away in my old Sony hifi
player. Now guess what happened: The first track which is about 25
minutes long and the center piece in the whole album is badly
distorted and sounds like a non-patched Linux kernel giving only
xruns! And this in a standard mass produced CD player by Sony! 

I cannot even give the CD back, because as a collector I just need to
*have* it. :( 

My only chance was trying to rip it and indeed cdparanoia managed to
produce clean sounding wav files which I reburned to CD. With things
like this it's no wonder the music industry is going down. They are
mistreating their paying good-willing customers. I didn't post high
quality ogg files of the album into a p2p network, but I was very much
tempted to do just that.

Hmmm.

Anyone noticed that copy protected cds actually force us to rip copies 
in order to hear the tracks we have bought.

Surely the powers that be have already thought of this fact. It appears 
to me like they are manipulating us.

Probably they are just forcing *everyone* to get used to the idea of 
listening to music via a computer. In the mean time they can make a shit 
load of money selling soon to be completely unnecessary products(DRM 
cdplayers) to stupid rich consumers. Until everyone buys online.

Now we all know what they are trying to do with new processors. So in 
the end they will have forced the average consumer to use a computer. 
(It will probably happen anyway, just take a little longer). Then they 
can totally control what we listen to and pay for by making it only 
available online from their portals. Anyone else will get sued under the 
table or bought out (classic business model there).

They definitely aren't going under. Instead they are actually herding us 
like usual and we are letting them because it's the status quo.

Ahhhhh, Status quo.

Maybe, but music was a particularly high profit business in the late 
20th century. I find the idea that this was just a passing phase 
intriguing - the hotel trashing rock star lifestyle turns out to be

I was recording a particularly roaring jam last night and my HDD 
overheated (I think).

Why does it always happen when you are doing your best work?

Anyway I have an extreemely large file which I cannot access with any of 
the players I have.

Does anyone know how I can check the file to see if there is any useful 
info in it and recover whatever was recorded?

I was using arecord so I assume that at least some of it was written to 
disk.

I'm thinking I need to scan the file for the ggod info then cut it up 
with some thing that cuts files into bits and discard the junk then put 
it back together or just put the parts into seperate files.

OK, I had to comment on this one.  Eric Clapton pays royalties to the
writer on everything he covers - just ask J. J. Cale (After Midnight,
Cocaine).  The Stones didn't cover much music, theirs was mostly
original.  When they covered, they paid (Harlem Shuffle).  If you're
trying to say that writing a blues tune is stealing just because it's 12
bar you're in pretty deep.  If that's the case who "owns" 12 bar blues? 
If you really want to nail those who stole verbatim and put their name
on it why not try Led Zeppelin (Killin' Floor and a cast of thousands).

Heh. I've been very disappointed by the two most recent "new sound
emerging from the underground" phenomena here in the US. There
was "electroclash", from my hometown of Brooklyn, which was touted as a 
new synthesis of dance music and punk but when I finally heard it was 
indistinguishable from early depeche mode / new order / etc.  
Then there's the neo-garage-punk thing - White Stripes, Hives etc. - 
it's OK I guess, but I swear I've heard it all before. Stooges, anyone?

I just picked up the reissue of Essential Logic on the Kill Rock Stars
label. Brilliant stuff mostly from 1978-1982, contemporaneous with
Gang of Four and the Raincoats; and nobody's done anything like it since.  
I keep wondering - where are the modern-day counterparts to these people?

Hi, I'm sorry that I don't have Jan's original message still handy to reply 
to, but reading this leaves me very confused about how the ripping process 
works.

For example, from the Cdparanio doc:

"Cdparanoia is a Compact Disc Digital Audio (CDDA) extraction tool, commonly 
known on the net as a 'ripper'. The application is built on top of the 
Paranoia library, which is doing the real work (the Paranoia source is 
included in the cdparanoia source distribution). Like the original cdda2wav, 
cdparanoia package reads audio from the CDROM directly as data, with no 
analog step between, and writes the data to a file or pipe in WAV, AIFC or 
raw 16 bit linear PCM."

So clearly this is strictly digital process. What you're describing sounds 
more like simply playing a CD in audio mode in your CD rom drive and 
recording via the analog connection to the sound card.

Either I'm in the twilight zone (cursing myself that I don't get the sci-fi 
channel for the tz marathon this weekend) or there's two different meanings 
to the phrase "rip a cd".

What's the story here?

Larry Troxler

I am trying to set up a sound card under RedHat9

Kudzu detected it as a Creative Vibra 16x PnP (CT4170)
So that is good but my apps (primarily XMMS) are trying to use /dev/dsp
I suppose I need to make /dev/dsp into a symlink to the new device, but
How do I find which /dev, if any, is setup as the new card? 

Or is there something else I need to do?

Thanks,
Ken Goudsward





-->><<--__-->><<--

Hi Larry,


Just my two cents, you can rip a CD in either analog or digital form.
Analog will incur some lossiness since the path is
CD-DA -> DAC -> ADC -> WAV
The ADC (analog to digital conversion) is a lossy operation.

Ripping directly from the CD is preferable since there is no ADC
involved.  But it is not necessary to get acceptable sound quality.

Programs like cdparanoia and EAC operate as digital rippers, using the
cdrom's built in mechanisms to extract the audio data directly.  There
are other programs however (such as cdsound-recorder) that will play the
disc through your CD drive's built in DAC, and record the sound through
your soundcards ADC input.  Or, you can use a standalone CD player for
the same effect.

Be sure that /dev/dsp is owned by the user you logged in as.
Check if artsd is running as your sound server.
If it is running then you have to run those programs that try to open 
/dev/dsp with artsdsp, like:
artsdsp play /usr/share/sounds/startup.
To play mp3 files with xmms you probably need to get the mp3 plugin for 
xmms.
Or, maybe artsd is not running.  Go to preferences -> Sound -> Sound 
server and enable it.

You can also use other sound servers as well.

Hi all,

Announcing immediate availability of Soundmesh Internet2 audio streaming
software.


1. What is Soundmesh

Soundmesh is a result of a collaborative work with Mara Helmuth. It
originally started as an "Internet Sound Exchange" Internet2 project and
has since grown to become a full-fledged audio streaming front-end. The
sole purpose of this app is to provide a mechanism for streaming
multiple 
CD-quality (or better) audio soundfiles via fast Internet2 connection,
utilizing hacked version of the RTcmix v.3.1.0. Hence, Soundmesh
provides for a unique "jamming" tool via Internet for a larger groups of
participants.


2. Obtaining Soundmesh

Soundmesh is currently only available in a source form and is
downloadable from my website. It's download is broken into 2 parts: the
soundmesh front-end (~530KB)and the hacked full version of the
RTcmix3.1.0 (8.2MB). They can be obtained using the following direct
URL's:

http://meowing.ccm.uc.edu/~ico/soundmesh/soundmesh-latest.tar.gz
(~530KB)
http://meowing.ccm.uc.edu/~ico/soundmesh/rtcmix-soundmesh.tar.gz (8.2MB)

Alternately, you can also find the download links on my website.

Documentation is also available:

http://meowing.ccm.uc.edu/~ico/soundmesh/Documentation.txt

Screenshot:

http://meowing.ccm.uc.edu/~ico/soundmesh/Screenshot.jpg


3. Current Limitations

*Soundmesh obviously does not currently support modular numbers of
incoming and outgoing streams. This is something that is planned for a
future release.

*Perl (.pl) scorefiles are supported in soundmesh but do not work in
RTcmix

*Python RTcmix scorefiles are currently not supported and do not work
with
either soundmesh or this version of RTcmix

*A number of playable streams before "gapping" occurs varies depending
on the quality of a stream and the internet connection. Considering that
this is an Internet2 project, chances are your modem connection will
simply not work [well or at all].

*Sound played via network is not heard locally (should be a quick fix).

*Connections are not secure.

Wow, I guess that either I have always been mistaken about this, or the meaing 
of the word has changed over the years. I always thought that "ripping" meant 
getting a byte for byte digital copy, converting the CD audio format to a 
soun file format. What you're describing, I always thought of as "taping". 

So when some in the Linux Audio world talks about, say, ripping samples from 
an audio sample CD into wavs, in order to load them into csound (just picking 
a likely application), do they mean they made an exact digital copy, or do 
they mean they made an analog copy? I always thought it would mean the 
former, but am I wrong? This is a quite important distinction, don't you 
think?

Larry Troxler









-->><<--__-->><<--

Yeah, I think your right, when I think of ripping I think of a cdparanoia
like process. Faster than realtime, (attempt) at a bit-for-bit copy.

- Seve



-->><<--__-->><<--
Hi,


Though I'm not a native english speaker, I would tend to agree with you. 
Though it was a long time since I last heard the word "taping" (or it's 
swedish counter part for that matter, incidentally "ripping" doesn't really 
have a swedish counterpart, as with many "newage" words...)


/Robert





-->><<--__-->><<--

Wow. They do this using that unsheilded wire on a ribbon cable that goes from 
the CD rom drive to the sound card? I never bothered connecting the two on 
any of my PCs,  because if I wanted to play audio CD's, I certainly would 
want to do it on my seperate stereo system, and not from a noisy PC.

Has anyone on this list actually made serious use of a CD-rom to soundcard  
analog connection? The idea sounds stupid to me, but maybe the noise issue 
isn't nearly as bad as I think it would be.

Larry








-->><<--__-->><<--

Sure - and Curtis Mayfield, Ike and Tina Turner etc etc. There's lots 
of material from those days on the cheaper Hendrix compilations. He 
played with many of the mainstream black artists of the mid sixties, 
but he still couldn't get a record deal for his own material.

It was after becoming known in England that he got to play with Miles 
Davis, mostly in private at Davis's house. I wish they'd been able to 
make a record together...

Cheers

Daniel



-->><<--__-->><<--

Sure, where it's a straight cover version. Assuming the original 
songwriter signed an excellent record deal, or somehow retained their 
copyright, they could have done very well. Unfortunately I don't 
think that was the case with most of the blues and R n' B artists. As 
Bo Diddley said, the word contract has the letters C O N in it.  


I think Chuck Berry might start to cough a bit at this point. Mr 
Diddley too, if he's still alive. But more than just cover versions, 
these 'British invasion' bands lifted guitar licks, vocal styles and 
even complete sounds from those artists. The Stones' 'Not Fade Away' 
is a Bo Diddley song in all but the name on the label.


I wouldn't call it stealing. But music is part of a cultural commons, 
so to put a fence around it and call it exclusive 'property' is out 
of order.


That's my point exactly. 


For sure. I think I already mentioned Zeppelin's jumbo jet. I've seen 
inside one of Jimmy Page's fine houses in London (they did a TV 
documentary on the Arts and Crafts architecture) and it's quite 
something. 

I think the Bonzo Dog Band put it best in the song "Can Blue Men sing 
the Whites?", a Clapton musical parody about a well-heeled musician 
who changes out of his mohair suit to put on some dirty jeans and 
sing songs about the Depression, "when people were really... 
depressed. Alright! Whoooo!"  

Cheers

Daniel



-->><<--__-->><<--

I think it's fine to rehash old musical styles, as long as you're 
honest about the orgins. Passing it off as 'new' to people who aren't 
familiar with the orginals is the fault of marketing and media types 
rather than musicians, in my experience.

I've got a theory that all kinds of music are happening all the time, 
but if you want to get a record deal you have to appeal to label 
bosses of a certain age - hence the current 80's revival. The trends 
are therefore dictated by whoever has the money to invest in creating 
them.  

Cheers

Daniel



-->><<--__-->><<--




yeah, if the quality of cable is reasonable its not bad. i only have PCs 
(and laptops) to play my CDs in - but i do notice a bit of noise. i've 
taken care to position the wire well away from the rest of my cards and 
drives - i previously had a wire of lesser quality which picked up all 
the noise from my 4 scsi hard drives inside the case. its still not 
perfect but okay.....

Larry,

	Sorry, I should have used the term record instead of rip.  The rest is
still relevant though.  If I can hear it, I can steal it.  Conversely,
if I can't hear it, I'll return it to the store.  DRM for audio (and
probably video) is a lost cause.

Hi Jason,
 

Gnu/Linux has evolved so much, but it still can give you pains. My experience 
has also passed through times of trouble, but recently I've been dealing with 
it almost in perfection, since installing and updating the planet-ccrma 
packages at http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/
This is RedHat based, so it would force you to change distro!!!
It is apt based so most installs and update are automatic and in fact a breeze.

If you want to try it out, I think it's one of the best sites around...

Let me know if it works out!

Cheers,
Carlos

	Mostly because his material was blues.  There wasn't a big market for
it at that time.  R&B was the big player.  Blues was reintroduced to the
US from England a bit later.  You guys had Big Bill Broonzy and a bunch
of other blues players floating around over there getting big audiences.

<OT editorial opinion>
	On a side note sort of related to England's appreciation of a form of
music that was developed in the US.  I've played in a number of places
outside the US - Monaco, Marseille, Pisa, Panama, ... - and I've noticed
that non-US audiences, for the most part, are much more appreciative and
attentive than US audiences.  We (and I use that term loosely) seem to
be more interested in 1) is this the latest cool thing, 2) looks, 3)
getting lucky, 4) getting hammered, 5) did I mention looks?  The least
important factor seems to be the music.  Don't know why that is but it
annoys the hell out of me.
</OT editorial opinion>


	Second that!

Jan





-->><<--__-->><<--
 
The audio levels from the CD will be reasonably high,
the source impedance will be quite low, and though you mention
unshielded cable I think shielded cable is more usual for this job.

If you have a pair of speakers hooked up to your sound card and no other
sound system in the room, and want to play "music while you work" this
is a convenient and acceptable solution. This applies to many PC users
in the world.

If you want to take the audio off a CD to store in the computer, process,
edit and copy to another CD or other digital media with the best sound
quality, possibly for semi=-professional purposes - no, it's not the best 
way.

In answer to your last question: no - I've never done it that way!

Pushing gently back to the earlier topic, what happens in cdparanoia 
when a CD has errors in it, whether because of defects or being copy
protected?

I know cdparanoia will re-read bad data until it gets a good copy or
gives up, but does the CD drive still do (a) the error correction and/or
(b) any necessary interpolation, or is that also done by cdparanoia?

	I'm not defending the record industry but Bo Diddley signed those
contracts.  So did Chuck Berry.


	Will Bach be upset that Chuck Berry lifted complete sounds from his
work at times?  Every musician uses pieces of everything he's heard from
the time he was born.


	Music as a whole is part of a cultural commons but my creativity in
writing a particular song is not.  Granite is pretty much common
property too but I don't own any of Michaelangelo's sculptures.  J. R.
R. Tolkien owned the rights to his works even though they were based on
the words and stories of others.  It was the way he put the words
together that mattered.



	This argument always bugs me.  I live in Mississippi and I've met many
of the still living Delta blues players.  Trust me, they're not very
depressed (or repressed) either.  In my opinion, anyone who has been
addicted to heroin and whose son has done a one-way nose dive out of a
fourth story window has a right to play the blues.  Yeah, he's not black
and he didn't live through the depression - lucky him.

	Yup.  Except in the case of Led Zeppelin ;-)  They put their names on
that stuff.  That wasn't a record company decision.

I suppose that's why Chuck always insisted on being paid in full, in 
cash, before he would go on stage. There's a famous story about a 
promoter in the UK having to push banknotes one at a time under the 
dressing room door. 


I don't think the lift was quite so complete, or close in time. To 
take the example of Bo Diddley, he would have been able to hear 
plenty of derivative music coming out of his radio while he was still 
working. On one level that's flattering, on another it must be 
upsetting - especially if the sound-alike bands are getting all the 
attention and making all the money.


Absolutely. There's a difference between influence and plagiarism 
though.


I'm not arguing that artists shouldn't be able to earn a living.

The general problem of 'intellectual property' seems to apply across 
many arts. Disney, for example, had very few orginal ideas, but is 
now keen to keep all the folk stories it borrowed in an 
ever-extending copyright envelope. Just parody or otherwise adapt 
Mickey Mouse, and see how far a defence of creativity gets you in 
front of the judge.


Those 60's British musicians weren't exactly starting with the raw 
stone - more like taking a mould of the sculpture. I think the 
imitation for the most part was sincere, and done out of respect, but 
this discussion was originally about proper attribution.   


Glad to hear it. I think the Bonzo's lyric was actually a joke :-)


I think Clapton's career as a bluesman was well established by the 
time those things happened.

Cheers

Daniel



-->><<--__-->><<--

Surely in a folk tradition there's an assumption that music is passed 
on from generation to generation? Musicians' egos aside, I've seen a 
greater emphasis on performance than 'originality' or proprietary 
authorship in that genre.

What I meant was that if you ask a musician directly, they are often 
modest and ready to acknowledge influences, where as the marketing 
people come up with all that 'best band in the world' or 'greatest 
singer of all time' stuff.
 
Cheers

Daniel



-->><<--__-->><<--

	That's outstanding.  I don't blame him a bit.



	Bo Diddley listened to (and borrowed from) every other blues musician
around at the time.



	The fairy tales *are* public domain, Mickey Mouse was an original
creation.  You can legally parody Mickey Mouse any time you want (it's
been done a million times).



	Bo Diddley did the same thing.  Robert Johnson got some of his lines
from other blues players of his day.  The wheel is always turning.  I
still remember the first time I heard La Grange by ZZ Top.  I was
walking through the parking lot of a local arcade and I heard irt
playing on the juke box.  I thought "Great, we've got John Lee Hooker on
the box!".  When I went to check it out I was wondering who the hell ZZ
Top was.  Bernard Bessman later sued over that song - ZZ Top settled out
of court and the settlement is sealed.  They've had other problems along
those lines too.  This is humorous because Jimi Hendrix at one time said
that Billy Gibbons was his favorite guitar player.



	He was on heroin before he was rich and famous.  My point was that
*everyone* has had it bad at some point in their life.  No one has
exclusive rights on suffering.  I get real tired of hearing that old
line - you can't play blues because you're A) white, B) not poor, C)
didn't grow up during the depression, D) not an alcoholic/addict, E) not
from Mississippi, F) fill in your reason here.  Music, of any genre, is
not the sole property of any one group of people.  You can still play
and write good reggae even if you're not from Jamaica ;-)

I once had an email conversation with the bass player of the Santana band,
Benny Rietveld. An excellent musician.

I asked him if he knew why the second movement of the 3rd Brahms Symphony was
not mentioned on the CD, which one of the songs is based on. (It was that
song with Dave Matthews singing, I forgot the name of it.)

He said that Carlos even played that music to the musicians in the studio.

I know that there are numerous people involved in the process of making a CD
before it gets shipped to the stores. But since then I have been losing some
of my respect for Mr. Santana. Come on, plagiarism sucks, even in the
sampling age.

Of course. He did have some original contributions to make, but he 
just didn't get the financial rewards for them. So when I hear the 
industry moaning that p2p is ripping off musicians, I sense 
hypocrisy.


I think you'll find that there was little original about Steamboat 
Willie.


Actually Disney have a long history of suing parodies - Air Pirates 
being the most famous I think:

http://reason.com/links/links011703.shtml


I think Clapton et al have every right to play the blues, just not to 
claim ownership of them. To illustrate the point, the RIAA could now 
sue an original Delta bluesman with a freely downloaded Clapton track 
on his hard drive. Doesn't that possibility, albeit theoretical, 
strike you as a bit odd?


Clapton also covered I Shot The Sherriff of course. Ironically, UB40, 
who are from the UK, partly white, and therefore not authentic enough 
for most white reggae fans, were massive in Jamaica.

Hi Larry,


I have done it before, and it really isn't that big a deal.  Obviously
the quality depends on your cdrom's dac as well as the quality of the
cable, noisiness of the environment, soundcard quality, etc, but at
least on my system I was able to get quite acceptable results.

Hi Larry,


In general, I've taken "ripping" to mean a digital copy, but the meaning
has seemed to change with the copy protection issues lately.  It would
probably be a good idea for people that use the term to make the
distinction between analog ripping and digital ripping when talking
about the subject or when describing a particular set of audio files.

Yeah, and when you listen to the origianls , like Willie Dixon, although
both use 12 bars, the black blues is different. However the Stones had
black blues musicians opening for them, and Clapton is accepted as a real
blues guy by people like BB King. I actually had a guitar workshop with
one of BB's old protege's who gave him some of his first radio airplay,
and I'm just some Sicilian WOP, but he told me I HAD to play the blues,
that I "got it" better than anybody else in the workshop, and after the
class I got all these invitations to come back to a couple of my black
female musician friends rooms to "kick it". 

My own music is heavily influenced by the african diaspora, as well as by
southeast asian music, but lately, after finding out the Sicily was a part
of ancient Greece, I've been delving into ancient Greek music to get into
my own personal roots, but I could never stop listening to jazz or blues
or hiphop, even though its not within my own native culture perhaps, but
music is about love, not culture.

If you want to hear some really creative US music, check out
filipino-american etrinity. Granted part of his style is derivative of uk
club music like 2step and drum and bass and also house, but he also
improvs everything live with a chinese erhu player on some tracks, really
cool stuff. Funny enough there's more creative US artists to be found on
mp3.com or their own websites than on major record labels. The labels
won't sign you unless you're being totally derivatie, you can't even get
gigs in clubs unless you're derivative. I perform live with linux but
can only get about half a dozen gigs a year and labels won't touch me with
a million foot pole. And its not because I suck, I've studied music at the
graduate level at calarts, that's unfortunately part of the problem. The
music industry is now completely divorced from creativity, everything is
100% derivative, unless it came up in the early 90s like Sonic Youth, who
manage to hang in there. Only in hip hop and rnb do I hear any creative
use of sound, a producer like R Kelly or Timbaland is getting a chance to
do more creatively. I've got my music on my own website:


http://asapien.org

and to hear etrinity:
http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/6/etrinity.html

and also check out professor vast, he's a local indian american artist who
plays a mix of hendrix, ed rush/optical and traditional indian sounds,
with some chord progressions grabbed off Miles Davis Kinda Blue album.

	Yeah.  I agree completely there.  It's just ripping off the RIAA's
member organizations (a very talented bunch I'm sure you'll agree ;) 
What's really interesting is that the RIAA and MPAA are constantly
bitching about p2p ripping them off but in almost all of the big cases
recently (Harry Potter, Madonna) the cat's been out of the bag before
the film or CD was even released.  So yes, they get p2p traded, but DRM
wouldn't have helped a bit.  They need to police their own people a bit
more carefully.  I actually don't understand the MPAA's position on
DeCSS.  They deliver a good product for a fair price (2 DVDs, special
features, liner notes, sometimes a poster for about US $20).  As I said
above, their stuff is pirated long before it gets to a DVD.



	I haven't seen this, however, if they were using the name Mickey Mouse
and/or making the character look almost exactly like Mickey Mouse then
that's not a parody and they should lose.



	Not a bit.  Each song, with the exception of near duplicates (My Sweet
Lord) is a unique work of art.  Whether you like his work or not, Andy
Warhol was an artist.  Did the guy that originally did the Campbells
Soup labels sue him?



	Exactly.

Right, well, this is a salient point. Indeed the right of anyone to Play
any style of music is held by anyone who loves that music. However,
there are certain tunes and lyrics which are effectively GPL'd. Part of
the living folk tradition requires that the song's history is known and
told at each performance (not rigidly adhered to, I know) as is the case
with many Gift Transactions. It is not appropriate either to rewrite the
tune and call it your own, although that is what countless 'pop' artists
have always done, and continue to do. Neither is it especially cool to
perform someone's work and claim that it's 'traditional'.

I was lucky enough to see Tim Rose play just before he died and was
struck by how 'Hey Joe' actually meant something when he sang it. Most
people still ask 'Tim Who?'. So sure most musicians start by learning
'Standards' and many attempts at writing one's own tunes simply end up
as blatant plagiarism. It's hard to find anything new under the sun. But
it can be done.

There is also the issue of use and proper crediting of samples etc..
Sometimes the blatant pirates come up with the most original ideas. Uh,
where were we?

Despite his right to play the blues, I still have a right not to buy 
Eric Clapton's music. And anyway, what right has Manu Dibango got to 
play Reggae ?~]

Hello!

I am trying to use jack 0.70.4. The reason for the old version is simple
- Rosegarden 4 0.9.1 fails to build with 0.72.4.

/tmp/jack is symlinked to /mnt/ramfs. 

I start "jack -d alsa" from a root terminal window. It starts
successfully (but with a warning about the "plug" layer). And it runs,
although it reports xruns every time I move a window. This lasts while
no clients are connected to jack.

Now I start "fluidsynth -a jack" from another root terminal window. (No
further parameters, and I have not attempted to get any actual sound as
yet). It connects successfully.

But very soon the following happens in the window that now runs jackd:

===

could not complete playback of 1024 frames
cycle execution failure, exiting
telling signal thread that the engine is done
jack main caught signal 1

===

With this, jackd exits.

The same happens if rosegarden is used as the client, instead of
fluidsynth.

What should I do to fix this problem?

Thanks in advance for any answers!

Yours, Mikhail Ramendik






-->><<--__-->><<--
Hello!

Sorry for the previous letter. The problem was fixed by pointing jackd
to the device hw:0 . Now it does not crash - but nor does it output any
sound!

I run all of the following as root, in this order, from different
terminal windows:

jackd -d alsa -d hw:0
fluidsynth --verbose -a jack YamahaGrand_Adcock.SF2 
noteedit

I use NoteEdit because I have already tested it with fluidsynth (but
without jack). The --verbose option for fluidsynth was added to diagnose
the problem.

So, I play something on noteedit - with all the default settings, in the
same way as before (with alsa, when it worked). And I see noteon and
noteoff lines in fluidsynth. But no sound is output!

Tried aplay to the device hw:0 for a test. It works fine. So, the
problem seems to be with either jack, or fluidsynth jack support.

Thanks in advance for any tips on fixing this!

Yours, Mikhail Ramendik

Hello!

Previously, noteedit worked all right in  my system, run as user. It
worked with fluidsynth (which was run as root) via alsa.

Now, it no longer starts as user. Instead it outputs a window that says:
===

An internal error happened somewhere.

The message is:
"correctReadTrillsSlursAndDynamics: internal error"
Error Code is: 5

The program must be interrupted.

===

As root, it still starts and works.

I have tried rebuilding noteedit; this did not solve the problem.

The change in the system was that I have built and installed jack,
ladspa and rosegarden. However, jackd is NOT running; nor is rosegarden.

Of course, it's possible to run noteedit as root - seems like I'll have
to do it with rosegarden anyway. But this is not something I'd prefer to
do. Perhaps there is a cleaner way of fixing this?

Thanks in advance for any answers!

Apparently, commercial pirates (those with their own pressing plants) 
have targetted the workflow systems that studios use to distribute 
material internally. You can buy an encrypted workflow system 
designed just to address this problem.

However, I can't help guessing that most of this material is either a) 
released onto p2p deliberately to help build pre-launch hype or b) 
sold by someone within the industry to pirates. I think a) is much 
more likely than b) because anyone involved with b) will never work 
in the industry again.

I saw a copy of The Two Towers before it came out - lent by a friend - 
that appeared to be a preview copy for the Oscars. Perhaps there's a 
member of the Academy who owes their dealer a lot of money...  


As a Region 1 customer it probably doesn't make sense, but here in 
Region 2 we are supposed to wait a year to see the movie you are 
talking about today, then pay more for it. Needless to say, 
region-free hacks are taken for granted here.  


I'm not sure where you can draw the line on parody, but my point was 
that there are some organisations who are very keen to take material 
from the cultural commons, but are not at all keen to see the 
material return to that commons. It's a bit like taking free 
software, changing it a bit and releasing it as proprietary.


Again I think it's hard to draw the line, but I don't think 'unique' 
is a word you could use to describe the songs in the pop charts. 
Derivative might be a better term, and there's nothing wrong with 
that - as long as you acknowledge the fact and credit your sources.


I think that's a good point - it sounds like a ridiculous idea, and 
yet that's what the intellectual property industry is all about. If 
Warhol was around today and came up with those paintings, he would 
either be sued, or worse still adopted as a corporate artist in 
residence!

Hallo,


I think, it's a mixture of b) and a). A lot of people not exactly *in*
the industry get access to releases before the actual release date.
For example journalists, who write reviews of a record (a game, a
book, ...), or the actual CD manufacturers.

Cracker or release groups just need a bit of social engineering to
have access to the CDs then. And with the increasing count of broken
CDs (using an alleged "copy protection") there sure are people who
think it a reponsibility to make "fixed" versions available.

So realistically the only way they can continue to make ridiculous 
profit is by controlling the technology that we have access to.

For example, I have found that with the Thai copies there are scenes 
missing from the dvd. I'm haven't noticed problems with the Korean 
copies though.

I assume the main reason for this is that Thais generally don't have 
access to technology as new as Koreans and also as much spending money.

Hello!

I am trying to use jack 0.70.4. The reason for the old version is simple
- rosegarden 4 0.9.1 fails to build with 0.72.4.

But before I can use rosegarden, I need to run fluidsynth. And I can't
get as far as this. Connecting fluidsynth's jack ports to the alsa ones
causes an immediate jack crash!

Any advice on getting this to work would be very appreciared! Deteils
follow.

I run three root terminal windows (rxvt or xterm - does not matter). In
one of them I start jackd; in the other, fluidsynth; and in the third,
try to get ports connected. Here is all that I do, and the output I get.

In the jackd terminal:

===

[root@ramendik misha]# jackd -d alsa -d hw:0
jackd 0.70.4
Copyright 2001-2003 Paul Davis and others.

port alsa_pcm:capture_2 has mixdown = 0x4001da28
port alsa_pcm:playback_1 has mixdown = 0x4001da28
port alsa_pcm:playback_2 has mixdown = 0x4001da28
starting engine

===

in the fluidsynth terminal:

===
[root@ramendik misha]# fluidsynth -a jack YamahaGrand_Adcock.SF2 
fluidsynth version 1.0.2

under certain conditions; see the COPYING file for details.

Type 'help' to get information on the shell commands.

===

This happens in the jackd terminal:

===
port fluidsynth:left has mixdown = 0x4001da28
port fluidsynth:right has mixdown = 0x4001da28
===

In the third terminal:

===
[root@ramendik misha]# jack_connect fluidsynth:left alsa_pcm:playback_1
engine sample rate: 48000
[root@ramendik misha]# jack_connect fluidsynth:right alsa_pcm:playback_2
engine sample rate: 48000
===

This causes an immediate crash of jackd, with this output:

===
cannot send event to client [jack_connect] (Broken pipe)
jack main caught signal 13
===

at the same time in the fluidsynth terminal:

===
fluidsynth: error: Help! Lost the connection to the JACK server
===

What "zombified" means is clear - it also happens if I simply Ctrl-C the
jackd terminal. So it looks like a jack crash, not a fluidsynth one.

Help... Thanks in advance for any tips.


Yours, Mikhail Ramendik

Hi Jelmer,

I don't know exactly what the problem may be, I do run the same configuration 
myself and it works just fine. 
Sadly I haven't done so for several weeks now (lack of time) and I forget 
which jack version I had, but I think that is the one...

Some standard questions:

- Does other apps work with the same jack?
  - if not: is the problem the same?
  - did you put the jack session files on a tmp filesystem?
- Are the apps self compiled, what compiler versions?

I actually heard one of the Gallagher brothers claim that the opening

Well, I was ready to help you with a big daddy tone, but this morning 
Jack fails to start here too, and I cannot see what I done wrong. I'm 
using 2.4.21-0.16mm-mdk on a Cel700&320RAM laptop, using a poor Intel810 
card (for now)

[root@satellite xix]# jackd -d alsa -d hw:0 (also tried jackd -R -d alsa

I'd like Jack to be launched at startup, like from /etc/rc.d/rc.local, 
but 1st I have to fully understand what it does and how.

#Can it be use as a standalone Audio daemon, like Arts or esd ?
#In this case how to tell KDE to launch it ? Or better, can I start it 
BEFORE and have KDE connect to it ?
#Is it designed to be run as root only ? Yesterday I managed to launch 
it as a user, and then still as a user, launch jack-rack that connected 
to it. Fact is, that was pretty much paradise, I'd like to do it again ;)
# Is there a better place to ask those Qs ?

Thank you very much !

That's the hint. Try removing the jack temporary files
from the filesystem /tmp/jack

Perhaps you've got OSS or artsd or something else
using the device--just guessing.


This can be done by enabling capabilities in your
kernel. I believe simple instructions are available in
the jackd faq on the website. The instructions are
there somewhere. The capabilities will enable normal
users to run jackd with -R realtime priority. jackd is
designed for pro audio so it's very strict about
having clients perform on time and if they don't
they're kicked.


You could try the jack dev list but the developers are
pretty busy and might not reply.

Just a reminder that I'm (trying) keeping up with Holborn and everyone else's 
new releases for Mandrake.  All updated packages are availale on all Mandrake 
cooker mirrors (like ftp://mandrake.redbox.cz).  If you're running cooker, you 
can just install them.  If you're running Mandrake 9.1, just rpm --rebuild the 
source rpm.

As an off-topic aside, Mandrake 9.2 should include all the best audio and 
video applications.  Some exceptions include csound, rtsynth, and jmax because 
of non-free licencing policies, but everything else is included.

I'd also like to thank Holborn for his cool new additions to the open-source 
music community.  I've used horgand quite a bit myself already.

Hi Austin,

torsdagen den 10 juli 2003 03.06 skrev Austin:

I guess you already know, but csound has changed license recently, but that 
was for the core parts only. I think the modules have their own licenses and 
it might not have rippled through just yet. 
But afaict it should be possible to bundle also in a while.

BTW, what are the policy of mandrake since rtsynth and jmax can't be bundled? 
I don't know about jmax, but with rtsynth isn't the only draw back that there 
is no source? Or is there some other license problem?


Another user for you Holborn! ;)

Really? I've never heard it played quite like that on any other 
record. Still, I don't think 'originality' matters to some people - 
as long as they're honest about the lack of it, I don't mind!

I suppose the problem is that some people believe if they acknowledge 
all their sources, it weakens their case to be identified as the 
composer.

I don't think it's the case in all traditions - for example, in reggae 
it's quite common to have a version with only minor adjustments put 
out under a completely different name and title. I think the 
assumption is that if you like music, you'll know where the original 
came from. Like the organ part on 'Double Barrell' by Dave and Ansell 
Collins, which is quite clearly lifted from 'Lay Lady Lay' by Bob 
Dylan.

Ardour (CVS) was in Mandrake 9.1.  Believe me.  I remember the torture of 
building and RPM for that.  Beta 2 is now in our development version, and it's 
SO much easier to maintain than the CVS code.  :-)

Hi all,

My cousin is working in a company that does a lot of audio/video
streaming solutions based on Linux systems. Now they look for an
application which provides similar things like SOX but in real time.
They would like to record on the input, manipulate it via GUI
(Eqalizer, effects...) and send it directly to the output.

Are there any recommendations for this kind of Linux software?

thanks

I think the video world calls it sweetening which is
what audio people refer to as mastering. So the
effects for broadcast aren't echo or distortion.
They're eq, compression, limiting, output volume.


If I'm correct about what your cousin is doing,
broadcast audio--live or recorded, then JAMin
(jamin.sourceforge.net) is the correct solution.

JAMin is a mastering/sweetening tool that includes;
eq, three band compression, limiting, output stage and
crossover. It will definitely help raise the floor for
subtle sounds and hold the ceiling on louder sounds
while increasing overall output and you can stream
through it live. The objective is to process audio so
it sounds appropriate while being broadcast from a
pair of 2" television speakers.

You can to save presets that will apply to specific
rooms, mics and source types so it'd give you a
variety of starting points tailered to specifics.

JAMin is an incomplete beta stage tool but it'll do
everything you need for broadcast audio requirements
and it's as stable as your jackd environment. You'd be
well advised to design and carefully test a jack
solution. It's a low latency realtime data server and
on a poorly designed or configured system will cause
problems. IMO, a well designed system would cause
broadcast audio processing to become almost invisible.

Hello folks,

I'm writing a realtime audio tool and I'd like to pick your brains on the 
following: say my app is rendering some sound and a midi event comes in, at 
what point in time should the resulting effect occur in the rendered audio 
stream?

The obvious solution would be to measure world/system time at the moment 
playback is started in my application. If a midi event then comes in, I can 
subtract this start time from the midi event time. I am however afraid that 
my timing will then drift each time an underrun occurs. I'm pretty sure 
applications like terminatorx, sweep and a host of others solved this 
problem before me so if anybody knows the answer to this, please let me 
know!

Regards,

Denis

p.s. I use JACK for audio output but the solution really should be 
independent of this.

Well, I just bought a M-Audio Quattro interface and some MIDI gear, and 
Mandrake 9.2 will be released this fall, so my objectives are:

1. Get the damn Quattro working.
2. Get all the MIDI gear working.
3. Get Ardour 1.0 and whatever verison of audacity we ship working well.
4. Get jack-realtime/alsa/kernel-multimedia working properly.
5. Update the Mandrake Audio Workstation HowTo to reflect these changes.

Ardour Beta 2 is already out, so I assume 1.0 should be ready by the fall, 
right?  I'm hoping to have my first 100% linux produced song recorded by next 
week.  Thus far I've been working with four-track analogue gear, and ALL my 
old tapes are fading, hence the Quattro to at least preserve the master 
recordings.

Hi guys and gals,

A friend of mine has been doing some very serious attempts at producing music 
with a fully linux based setup lately. 
There has been lots of pitfalls along the way, but since he is a _very_ 
dedicated guy he has come a long way towards pulling of his goal. 

The goal in question being to produce an "album" purely in linux. (album in 
the sense that the songs are freely downloadable from the same web page on 
the net, i think ;) )

He has just started to document the thing, you can have a look here:
http://computerville.homeip.net/linuxmusic/, there are also some samples of 
what he has produced this far, in my opinion it shows that linux audio is 
getting 'there'.

Have a nice weekend,
Robert

Hello!
  I just discovered two problems with ardour:
 1. If you run the autogen script the -gui and -ksi options are exchanged.
Where it says -gui it says something like libs="libs_base ksi" and in the
ksi-case it wants to include the gui-libs.
  2. The next thing something running ardour-ksi. I've jack-0.7.3 and I seemed
to fullfill all the other dependencies. But now when I try to start ksi it
says:
/usr/local/lib/ardour/ksix: relocation error:
/usr/local/lib/ardour/libardour.so.0: undefined symbol: _ZTI8QMThread
  So and that's all. this ardour version is from tuesday morning.
  Any ideas about the second problem?

Have you checked out Java Audio? Or the Java Media package, it allows you
to process streams and do recording. Maybe gstreamer would work as well,
and I've also seen it done with pd, on the pd user's list this one guy has
a php app that controls pd that streams onto icecast, its got a slick
flash front end, so flash is sending signals to this php/pd app.

Here's some brief background before I get to my question:

-I'm building a linux daw from scratch (including external hardware)
-I've just put together a dual athlon 2400+ machine and have
(tentatively) installed mandrake
-I'm running out of money *fast*

The third point has put a damper on my soundcard/preamp/mic plans.
Initially I'll be happy to just record 1-2 channels at a time, but my
goal is to be able to do a decent job with a drum kit, possibly with
guitar or bass at the same time. I figure I can squeeze that in to eight
channels.

Ideally, I'd like to be able to buy a delta 44 now (for financial
reasons), and then buy another, or possibly a 66, later on and add it to
the set up. If I do this I can get a decent mic and preamp. Otherwise, I
have to go with the 1010 now and use a $20 radio shack mic until my bank
account recovers.

I checked around the lad archives and this question seems to come up
from time to time, but I'm wondering if this is possible with what's
currently out there.

Thanks,
Peter




-->><<--__-->><<--

I'd have thought that dual Athlon 2400 is overkill for 8 channels and
some savings on CPU power would have bought you a mic preamp, but it
looks like it's too late now.

It'll be nigh impossible to bank multiple soundcards well unless they
have a method of synchronizing to a clock.  Unfortunately, that sort of
thing doesnt hit the Delta line until you get to the 1010s, I believe.

I'd say that if you have the $$ for the 1010 now, get it, then follow
that up with an inexpensive mixer (the mic preamps in the Behringers
are surprisingly good) and a few SM57s & 58s and stands and cables.

You can't sync two 44's, they will drift as you record.
Also, the 1010 does the analog to digital conversion in
the breakout box, while (contrary to what some believe)
the 44 does not.  It doesn't even have true balanced
connections to the soundcard ("I've opened mine and looked,
but counting the pins in the cable is enough to see this).
For what it's worth, I love many things about my 44, but
it is a son of a bitch to get the thing to work without
the dreaded "xruns".  I finally had success though, with
jackd and Ardour, running with root privs.

As for the Drum kit, I know it is desireable to
record many channels of drum separately, but would
it do to simply use say a Mackie 1402-VLZPro mixer
to funnel the drum mics into two or three channels?
You would have to get the mix right the first time,
I know, but the 1402 would give you six very nice
channels of mic pre, which should ease the budget
problem.  You also get phantom power, which you must
not forget that you need to power any decent condensor
mic.

If you get in a pinch, you can pick up a pair of
Marshall MXL2003's for a very reasonable price, and
in my limited experience yield a natural bright sound
that would be very tough to match for the same price.
Anyway, go for the large diaphragm condensors.

If it is to be a $20 mic, I recommend the radio shack
33-3017.  I have a pair, and they don't compare well to
the Marshall's, but they are also hard to match for the price.

Hi,

I hesitate to ask this here, since it's gotta be a basic shell thing, and 
certainly not audio specific, so if you want to flame me for me OT and 
laziness, go ahead.

The problem is that when I run I run an X application from a console (for 
example, "pd &" or "rosegarden &", the console output from all the 
applications I run are interleaved onto the xterm that I started them from.

That part is fine.

The part that is not fine, is that the output is not labeled with the 
application that it came from.

For example, I seem to remember that if in the past, if you ran grep, for 
example, anything that grep sent to its console would be prefixed by "grep:". 
I thought that this was a convention that the apps followed, and not a shell 
thing (I seem to remember "printf("%s: ...", argv[0], ....")

Hopefully, I'm wrong about this, and there is a shell option that puts the 
application name in front of every line of output. Is there?

If it's not something I can make happen in the shell, then how is everyone 
dealing with this? Currently I am actually opening a seperate xterm for each 
X application that I run, which is quite cumbersome, because it means that I 
have to manage twice minus one as many windows as I would if I could have all 
the output into one xterm, identified with where it came from.

Looking forward to any ideas and any pointers to my misconceptions.

Larry:
Each process that is running has 3 devices:
Device 0: standard input:  the keyboard
Device 1: standard output:  the monitor
Device 2: standard error output :  somehow goes to the monitor.

To trap error messages you need to redirect the standard error output 
somewhere, for example:
printtool 2>/tmp/prt.log &
netscape 2>/tmp/net.log &



That is:

[command and options here]  2>  log_filename_here

The ampersand will send the command to the background.

You can create a shell script with several lines and run it from a link 
to it on the desktop.

Then you can check the log files with cat, more, less, etc, etc.

If you want to run several commands from one xterm session, you can do 
the following:

printtool 2>&1 | sed 's/^/printtool: /g' &
netscape 2>&1 | sed 's/^/netscape: /g' &
gimp 2>&1 | sed 's/^/gimp: /g' &

2>&1 means to redirect the standard error output to the standard output 
( Device 2 to device 1).

Each error line will be preceded by the command name.

I hope this will help you.

Ewww... that would be terrible if I wanted to capture the output of a program
for later processing :)

No, you're thinking of stderr output, which by convention is
often prefixed with '$0:'.   I mean, how would you like it if
you typed 'ls', only to get back:

ls: slow.wav
ls: slow.wav2
ls: smc_router_firmware
ls: sober
ls: sound
ls: soundon.log
ls: spell
ls: spell.bak
ls: src

etc...   No, that's too Microshaft.  Here is a possible solution:


Create an executable shell script in your path that looks like this:


#***** SCRIPT *****
function showme(){
         while read foo
                 do echo $1: $foo
         done
}

$@ | showme $1
#***** /SCRIPT *****

I called mine, "identify".

Now, let's test it with grep:

sinewave:toby:toby> identify grep foo *
grep: Binary file DSC00326.TIF matches
grep: Binary file QtC-0.0.2.lsm matches
grep: adf: afsdadsfadfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdf toby adfadfadf foo
grep: adf: print('myfoot', 'myfoot');
grep: adf: print('yourfoot', 'yourfoot');
grep: doit: while read foo
grep: doit: do echo $1: $foo

So, now stdout and stderr get prefixed with the name
of the program.  Easy, yes?

Well, it's not just the standard error, but the standard (console) output that 
I'm interested in.


Yeah, but I I don't need log files - it's enough for me to just see the output 
of my programs in an xterm.


Well, yes, this would work, but it seems very brain-damaged. I mean, do people 
really use this approach to keep their output seperate?

I find it hard to believe that this is the answer. I can't imagine that it's 
common practice for everyone to pipe into sed every time they run an X 
program.

Ahh, I see your point now.


Well, ok, maybe easy, but still ...

I guess the answer to my original question is that, yes, people fire up a 
seperate xterm for each audio app they launch :-)

I mean, I have a hard time believing that what you're describing is common 
practice.

Thanks for your time! (really, thanks!)

OH!  You also want the std. output.
I read the shell given by toby-DxQTOWRjbNsdnm+yROfE0A@public.gmane.org and it is also a good solution.
You can pipe things to sed, awk  which are the most commonly used 
commands for editing the std. output using pipes.  That is, without 
using temp files.
As you can see, Toby's example does not use sed, awk. It uses echo. But, 
he has to use a while loop.

So, you can have:

A 4 line shell script called runit :


#  runit  command options
cmd=$1
# In case $1 has sub directories, then get just the command name
cmd=`basename $cmd`
#
expr="s?^?${cmd}: ?"
eval `echo "$* 2>&1 | sed '$expr' " `



This script can be installed under /usr/bin .

To run a command type:

runit [command] [command_options]


Standard output and std. errors will be displayed on the xterm with 
command name included.

After all, what I love in Unix is that YOU CAN do these kind of things. 
  Everything is possible.
I recognize that to be able to do this 4 line script takes too much Unix 
experience.

I am using basename to get the filename in case you run:

runit /usr/local/bin/netscape   &


I define expr to create the argument sed expects.  I use quetion marks 
to avoid conflicts with slashes.


Life is harder on any other MOST popular operating systems...specially 
those that crash so often in a daily basis.

I downloaded the track "nasty valve1" an gave it a listen.
Hmmm the Intro is quite impressing - lot of personality, cool groove.
But after 20 seconds or so i hear a GM-Drumkit wich reminds me of a
Yamaha middleclass PSR-Preset - not that much personality anymore -
quite plastic i must say.
I do not blame this on your friend/musician - i guess the problem is
iiuwsynth`s soundfont-bullshit.
Whithout an implementation of a real drumsampler, Muse cannot do much
better i fear. 
The Synthsounds are very promising though...

You should check out JAMin for mastering -

it's already useful.  I'm working on selectable scenes right now.  You
could add it to your list - T-RackS for $400 vs JAMin for $0.  I keep a

I don't understand this whole 'drift' thing. If I'm able to listen to a

sync with the recording) with either card, how is it possible for them
to be out of sync with each other?

I'll consider this, but my original plan was to spend my money on
getting the best soundcard, preamps, and mics and doing as much as
possible in software. The idea was to get the highest quality crucial
hardware i could afford, and do any and all mixing, processing, etc, in
software (which is putting a lot of faith in linux ;) ). I know it's a
fine line, though.

I was exaggerating about the $20. I'll end up with at least an sm57 or
sm58 (or comparable) for starters.

Peter,
   It's easy for people to not see this problem the first time they look at
it, but it's usually not that difficult to explain, given a bit of basic
engineering background.

   All of these sound cards have oscillators on them to allow them to sample
and playback at a given rate, such as 44100 Hz. the problem is that no two
oscillators (or the crystals that drive them) produce EXACTLY 44100 cyles
per second. They are spec'ed to be within a certain tolerance, like 1%, or
+/- 100 parts per million, but the point is that they are not creating
exactly the 'right' number of cycles per second.

   With this in mind, if you have two sound cards (same models, different
models, it doesn't matter) and they run from separate clock sources, then
one of them might be operating at 44099 cyles per second, while the other is
operating at 44101 cycles per second. If this was the case, then (in
differeing by 2 cyles per second) after 22050 seconds they would be out of
sync by one complete second. (The slow one would be one second behind.)
Since the human ear can pick up very minute differences in time, the effect
becomes noticible much more quickly than that though, and unfortunately,
most crystals will be much further off than 1 cycle per second from the
spec.

   The reason you can play the same track back, over and over, and even on
different sound cards, is that while 44100 samples 'represents' on second,
it may not 'take' on second to play back. You ear is pretty insensitive to
the idea that a song played on your CD player in the house takes 3:49.203
seconds, while in the car it might take 3:49:542 seonds. We are just not
sensitive enough to hear that, although the pitch in the house would be
measureable as slightly higher.

   All this said, it is NOT true that you cannot use two (or more) sound
cards at the same time. You can, but they have to be clocked from the same
clock. you can accomplish this on any pair of sound cards that support the
Word Clock interface, and I've been able to do it over ADAT interfaces with
multiple cards, but that's not for the uninitiated. ;-) It's harder to set
up.

   I hope this helps clarify the physical reasons that this is difficult.

   There is a software reason also. Linux/Alsa will onlt interrface to a
single clock, so clocks being generated by two sound cards are not something
that Alsa is designed to handle.

Cheers,
Mark

Well, I use Swami to build my own sound fonts, I have some quite gritty
ones, cause my old band-mate is the producer for The Freestyle Fellowship
(if you haven't heard of them, they've been the underground legends of Hi
Hop for 12 years now).

Anyways I find Csound to be the tool of choice for serious composition in
a linux only environment. Personally I don't go quite that far, I use muse
and rosegarden to sequnce my midi gear, I have an asrx pro and a korg
electribe s. Unfortunately I've found jack/iiwusynth to be too unstable to
work with.

Thus I'm using midi and muse to sequence my outboard gear and then I use
broadcast2000 to record the tracks and to overdub acoustic instruments.

Its not completely linux only, but linux is the only computer os I use in
making my music.

Exactly. Joe is an awsome producer, check out their albumn from 2001, Joe
is producing and the beats are just fluid. He uses nothing but an adat
and an asr10 keyboard, and that's it. 
Once jack gets mature then you'll be able to do more and more with just
linux. Already I can do complete live sets just playing terminatorX on
linux and that's it, though I usually play live guitar and sync together
my adrenalinn with my korg es1 and then I put the audio from terminatorX
through the korg to process it. I think linux works just as well with
midi gear as mac/windows does, especially Suse, I've had the best results
so far with Suse 8.2, but its not suprising given that Suse employs
geniuses like Takashi Iwai.

configure can't find fftw3f. I just installed version 3 alongside version
2.1.5, which is Gentoo's current version which I can't remove because many
things depend on it. I tried setting PKG_CONFIG_PATH to /usr/local/lib but
no luck. Could you maybe put in a --with-fftw-prefix= option to configure?

You have to set --enable-float on the ./configure line for fftw3.

I need to save some $$ so I can visit Korea to do some gigs, its not that
gigs are impossible to come by, I had break dancers doing head spins to
linux at the Knitting Factory in Los Angeles. But I tried to do a weekly
Monday night club, and it didn't work out, only 5 people showed up the
first night and I got shut down. However I've been performing live for
linux users groups, I did a really good live performance at the Linux
User's Group of Los Angeles and hope to play at the SCALE event this
year. I also played a great linux - only show at the Salvation Theater in
Silverlake. In Los Angeles there are just so many bands, and so many major
record label groups that the competition for the dwindling number of
available clubs is really brutal. I'm probably going to have to travel to
orange county to get weekend gigs.

I'd actually reccomend that you start out recording a max of four
channels of drums.  Here are some reasons:

1) a max of four channels is a lot less complicated to learn on
2) a lot less mic position to play around with, but mic position can be
easier to hear.
3) you might be surprised at how great three channels on a kit can sound.

I run four channels to my drum kit - bass, snare, and two overheads.
I'm limited to four with my delta44, but I really don't think it's a
problem.  If I had more channels, I'd just record more of my band live
and not overdub as much.  Most of the time, I think the snare mic is me
being excessivly geeky ::-)


I've got a pair of MXL 990's for overheads and they are suprisingly
sweet.  I read quite a bit of rmmp and rap archives before choosing them
(since they were cheaper than a few other mics I could've bought), but
it really seems like people like them more.  They sound really great on
my kit, and only cost me $69 each!

In fact, there are often times I go with the 990's over a 57 - of course
your mileage and preferences may vary.


33-3032's are way cheap now if you can find them (discontinued, I'm
afraid) and sound pretty good on toms and snare.  I bought a pair before
they dried up from the local RadioShacks for like eight bucks each.
Call around.

Hello,

I have a few friends that are heavily into their car stereos with the
heavy bass. They have all sorts of CDs (bass mechanik?) that have some
cool techno loaded with some heavy hitting low frequency bass. This got me
curious, and since I can't find anything on Freshmeat or Google (or just
am not using the right terms) I was wondering if anyone here knew of such
a program that can generate some nice smooth bass. I have played with one
of the drum editors (the popular one? cant remember the name) but of
course it didn't seem to have any lower frequency generating drums.

If anyone could point me to something like this I would be greatly
appreciative!

Thanks,

	Bryan






-->><<--__-->><<--

It appears that good low frequency drum sounds are a combination of 
synth and sine waves . You may have to experiment with a few different 
tools to get the sound you want.

Bass sounds are the true art of laying IMO.

I vaguely remember, and I am talking years ago, a doc that explained
how to drive two soundcards with the same crystal (from one of the cards)
that involved only minor soldering.. A quick google did not work.. Anybody
remember?

Maarten




-->><<--__-->><<--


Get a mono synth, use a saw tooth or triangle wave, fiddle with the 
cuttoff of the LPF and tweak the resonance to your liking. Stick a 
compressor in front of it when you record. Good bass all around.

-->><<--__-->><<--

Marteen,
   Hi. I'm sure you could even remove the crystals completely and drive
multiple sound cards with a signal generator. We do that with some of our
cards now and again, but only for testing. It does work. However, beyond the
base frequency issues in the crystal, you also need to watch out for jitter
to. I would get worried that wires running all over the place would not give
good signal integrity at the end of their runs which would cause distortions
of other types.

   Far more simple, should Peter have the interest, would be linking
multiple cards via ADAT. (or even spdif) For instance, a single HDSP 9652
has 3 ADAT outputs. One of outputs can go to the ADAT input of a second
card. If the second card is set to use that ADAT input as a clock source,
then it will sync to the first with no problems. I do this today between 3
computers - A Linux box with an HDSP 9652, A Pro Tools box with it's own
ADAT interface, and a Windows ME box with a Hammerfall 9632. All three boxes
are synced via ADAT. It works great once you get everything set up. (Others
have suggested that ADAT is not good enough to do this. I find it works
quite well with RME cards as slaves as they have very good input PLL's.)

Anyway, I'm sure there are others out there doing similar stuff to what I'm
doing, and maybe a few that are soldering cards together also! ;-)

Cheers,
Mark

I downloaded all files for ALSA release  0.9.5.  They are:
alsa-driver-0.9.5
alsa-lib-0.9.5
alsa-tools-0.9.5
alsa-utils-0.9.5

You probably downloaded the tar file that is under the directory 
"other".  I found that it is obsolete.  Running configure will fail with 
alsound libs not found.

What I did is to look for the envy24control  directory under 
alsa-tools-0.9.5.  Then, on that directory I run:

./configure
make

It will compile it successfully.



I was not able to try it because I have another sound card.

Remember to run make install.


Give it a try.

I had the same problem. If you check the limiter should be there.

$ ls /usr/lib/ladspa/

You need

$ export LADSPA_PATH=/usr/lib/ladspa

Better yet, put it in /etc/profile.env

This surprised me since plugins work with other apps. I wonder if
they just use a default? But that should get things going.

i dont know why fftw3 is taking so long to reach portage :(
there is a bug in bugzilla for it
see: http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20048

i accidently already commited the jamin-cvs.ebuild

which currently uses the ebuild i submitted with a package name of
fftw3...

but using the slotted ebuild seems better.
you must change the dependency to >=dev-libs/fftw-3.0 in that case.

nice to see so many gentoo users here.


and if you need something in media sound then tell me.

Would not a software/driver-solution to synchronize the

somthing similar to ntp.

This would need=20

    2: a way to delay the the stream running over the hardware

But I doubt that this idea could get far, probably timing would
become a rather statistical than exact procedure in this region.
And expensive too. Also, maybe clocks are not even stable over
time (temperature, etc.) and would have to be remeasured
periodically. Also, I bet this idea has been around earlier and
if possible we would already have it realised.

The psycho-acoustic boundary for discerning discrete acoustic
events/clicks is about 1/20 s, AFAIR, so 50 ms would have to be
beaten to satisfy the ear.

Bj=F6rn




-->><<--__-->><<--

I don't think it's possible. My thoughts:

1) To the best of my knowledge sound cards tell you when the frame occurs.
Not only are the clocks different frequencies (by a small amount) but they
run completely unsynchronized, so the start of frame on one sound card could
be anywhere within the frame on the other, and I've never heard that this
can be controlled at all.

2) Most important, every time this conversation has come up on Alsa-Dev, my
impression is that the developers have less than zero interest in tackling
the problem since the Word Clock/ADAT clock/spdif clock solutions do exist.

   Technically I think there may be solutions, but practically speaking the
problem get immense. Should you ever advertise that it works, you know you
are going to have some young guy with a weird pair of cards, like a SB-16
and a USB device, asking why it doesn't work for him. No one else will have
the same hardware, so no one will be able to debug why.

   Heck, we can't even get Alsa drivers to work reliably for single cards -
why go after this issue? ;-) ;-)

Greetings:

  While we were in Italy last week Ivy (a.k.a. my Better Half) purchased
two DVDs and a VHS video. I knew that I took a chance on the discs,
they're both region-encoded so I figured they wouldn't play in Ivy's
standalone DVD player. Sure enough, the player refused to recognize the
discs. However, I _am_ able to play them on my Linux box, so now even
Ivy agrees that Linux rules.

  Now I have some questions:

    Is there some way to change a hardware DVD player to accept another
region coding or is it necessary to buy a standalone player keyed to the
disc's region code ?

    How does it happen that my Linux players recognize these discs with
no trouble ? Would a Windows or Mac player do as well ?

    The VHS tape is still a problem. Our player doesn't seem to like it,
no picture appears but we can hear the audio moving along at something
like twice normal speed. Can anyone tell me what's up with that and if
there's some way to fix it ? TIA !

Best regards,

== dp



-->><<--__-->><<--
I was able to change my Fisher DVD player to accept DVDs from all 
regions by a combination of commands from the remote control.  I don't 
have any DVDs, other  than Region 1 to test it with , though.   There 
are websites that have this info for the various DVD machines.
As far as the VHS goes, it's a PAL tape, and it needs to be converted to 
NTSC to be seen on a domestic (North America) VHS deck, or it can be 
viewed on a multi-system deck.  Quite a few of the PAL decks in Europe 
can play NTSC, but it doesn't work the other way around.  

Good Luck!

/mel







-->><<--__-->><<--

It could be a couple things - on one hand, I wouldn't be surprised if
the free software to access DVDs has code to work around some region
limitations.  This could be helping you.  Also, some early DVD-ROM
drives were produced before region coding became prevalent - you might
have region-free DVD hardware.


The format for video tapes is actually different in North America.  That
tape is probably encided in the PAL format (NTSC is the name of the NA
standard).  The easy way is to buy a PAL VCR.  Someone else might have a
better solution.

Completely depends on the player - some allow you to change the region a
fixed number of times.


Magic :)  (Translation - I have no idea!)  But it's heartening to know
it worked.  My guess is that Windows machines would be careful to honor
the region encoding because MS is so closely aligned with the MPAA with
regards to digital rights management.  Dunno about Macs, but my guess is
that they'd honor the region encoding as well.


Your tape is likely in the PAL format, the European standard for TV
broadcasting.  It has a different number of lines scanned per second
than the NTSC format used in the US.  I think your only option here
is to find someone with a PAL VCR and get them to dub a copy onto an
NTSC VCR.

Hallo,


I had this experiment lying around: http://footils.org/snd/bigbass.ogg

Basically it's just like your suggestion, done in Pd. I used Steves
SC1-compressor, but could someone suggest nice setting for bass
compression? Somehow I didn't hear any difference. For example in the
ogg-file, there are both clean and compressed signals, but they sound
the same to my ears...

About 5 years ago we (me and _my_ better half) bought a video tape in
China ... It played similarly to Dave's ... no picture and screwed up
audio. 

Does anyone know if PAL is the standard in China as well?

Not familiar with SC1 but maybe it's similar to SC4?
It's all arbitrary and depends on the instruments
relationship with everything around it but this can
create a controlable instrument.
attack; 100 
release; 650
threshold; -30
ratio; 4:1

Attack controls the amount of time it takes before the
compressor starts working.
Release how quickly it stops working
Threshold when it starts
ratio 1:1 level is one decibal in equals one decibal
out, 4:1 is four decibal in to cause one decibal
increase but when this occurs is dictated by the
Threshold.

So to test, ram the ratio to the extreme 20:1 and
throw the threshold up and down all the way. There
should be an output meter that shows gain reduction.
You'll see the meter report what you're causing and
that'll probably help you begin to hear what the
compressor is doing.

If you're talking about a bass drum and want that
beater slap then stick a gate infront of the
compressor and use the opening of the gate for
tonal/shaping--a tight threshold with a long decay.

I'm not familiar with SC1 but I know SC4 and it's an
effective compressor.

 Somehow I didn't hear any difference.

IIRC Italy uses *two* formats, both flavours of PAL. I don't know about 
interoperability between the two formats.




-->><<--__-->><<--
Hallo,



Thank you for your tips, I'll try them out. SC1 doesn't have a
sidechain, so controling it with a gate isn't possible, but I could
try SC4 instead. Actually I was trying to get bass tones fatter with
the compressor, so that they don't really fade out.

I was confused about the SC series anyway. My
familiarity is with what's in JAMin.

Reguardless you can put a distinct gate in front of
the compressor. But that's more of a drum thing.

Basically you're controling audio energy. If you turn
up the volume, the energy becomes chaotic. The setting
and principles should help out. I just looked and
there's meters for some of the SC compressors. They're
definitely helpful when learning to hear how a
particular compressor behaves. They're all different.

Incidentally, I use compression on almost everything
albeit it's often very little and sometimes it's just
for an added gain stage.

Le mar 15/07/2003 =E0 22:48, rob fell a =E9crit :


You may be speaking about the specifically french SECAM standard,
which is different from PAL only in the colour coding.

If you watch a SECAM tape on a PAL TV+VCR,
there will be no problem.

If you watch a PAL tape on a SECAM TV+VCR,
you will see the whole thing with full images and sound quality,
except it will be black and white ! ;-)

SECAM is more and more abandoned as it is (was ?) french only.

NTSC shows 30 images per second,
PAL an SECAM only 25, but more lines are displayed on TV.

More and more european TVs and VCRs are NTSC compatible.

A friend of mine with a Mac OSX machine has DVD's from two regions
(his wife is Japanese), and the player that comes with the Mac says
you can only change a fixed number of times, but there are websites
that have a program that resets the number of times.

Greetings:

  I couldn't find the answer to this one on Google, so:

    Which Linux distributions include wxWindows in their default
installations ?

Best regards,

== dp



-->><<--__-->><<--


Mandrake:
wxWindows 2.4 and 2.5 are both currently in the contrib repositories.  That 
means they come on the DVD edition (IIRC), and the 7 CD edition, but not on 
the download or regular edition of Mandrake.  It also means that it is not 
supported by the Mandrake support team, because it is maintained by volunteers.

According to the responses I've collected so far it seems it's a little
out of date.

My thanks to all who replied. It seems that it's a standard package with
most of the mainstream distros, with the interesting exception of Red
Hat. I haven't upgraded for quite a while, and wxWindows was not
included with my ancient 7.2 install. Is it not in 8.0 or 9.0 either ?

Hi. 
I released ZynAddSubFX 1.4.2 on
http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net

News: 
      - (small) tutorials
      - added full-featured, advanced formantic
filters
      - added mixer panel which lets you to see/change
most important part settings, and shows a vu-meters
for each part
      - you can choose to process the instrument's kit
items only with one Part effect (eg. you can make a
instrument kit that contains a reverberated piano and
flanged strings)
      - enabled to launch more instances in Jack
      - when is launched first time, it searches for
default.bnk_zyn file into /usr/share/zynaddsubfx and
/usr/local/share/zynaddsubfx directories (useful for
binary packages for Linux distributions)
      - bugfixes

For those that you don't know, ZynAddSubFX is a
poweful software synthsizer for Linux and Windows.

FreqTweak is a tool for realtime audio spectral manipulation and
display. It provides several algorithms for processing audio data in
the frequency domain and a highly interactive GUI to manipulate the
associated filters for each. It also provides high-resolution spectral
displays in the form of scrolling-raster spectrograms and energy vs
frequency plots displaying both pre- and post-processed spectra.

whether the music I make together with a friend is against God and Jesus
or not, since I never thought about the music I make in such a way (I
just enjoy creating it). Could you please listen to some tracks on our

well) would agree to use your software for my music? I would really
appreciate it and I'm looking forward to check out your zynaddsubfx!!!

ZynAddSubFX does not set up any default route for the output through JACK.

Actually, I saw that statement on the ZynAddSubFX site and assumed it 
was an extra clause in addition to the GPL. As Paul owns the 
copyright (which I assume he does) he's entitled to add any extra 
licence restrictions he likes to his own software, as a 'GPL plus'. 

That might mean it's not strictly 'software libre' of course, but Paul 
does say 'please' rather than 'you may not use' though.

I'm unsure how the heavy metal clause is measured against, or 
enforced. We're not Satanists here, but the guitar riffs can get a 
bit heavy sometimes.

I can respect the request not "to make music that is again

but the generalization "(eg. HeavyMetal, NewAge,..etc..)"
is such a demonstration of ignorance that I will refuse to

Greetings,

I seem to be having a problem with Jack and Ardour. Ardour keeps 
stopping while I'm recording and a dialog box comes up that says "JACK 
has either shutdown or it disconnected Ardour because Ardour was not 
fast enough. You should save the session and restart both JACK and Ardour".

I'm running Jack as root with the following:

jackd -R -d alsa -d hw:0 -r 44100

I've changed the buffer size (-p) to  512, then 1024 and then 2048 and 
it had no effect, so appearently it has nothing to do with the buffer 
settings.

I've also tried to run it in fvwm2 just in case KDE was too much for it. 
But had the same problem.

I've already did all the IRQ and latency test when I was learning 
ecasound. In fact, ecasound seems to run fine.

I'm running the versions of Jack and Ardour that came with SuSE 8.1 
(Jack 0.37.2-27) (Ardour cvs20020816-21).

Any help would be appreciated
Thanks... Rocco

Are you recording to a journalling filesystem? See the jack
FAQ if you are. I suggest updating to current releases.

Edit /etc/fstab to mount your /tmp dircectory in ram (as tmpfs preferrably).  
It's documented on the jack homepage.

Until I did this, it was the worst bottleneck for latency.

Hallo,


No, he cannot write a GPL plus this way. The GPL (2) says: 

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
  running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
  Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
  the Program (independent of having been made by running the
  Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
  
So the act of using the software isn't an issue covered by the GPL. 


Yes, that's an important observation. As a lot of (christian)
theologists for hundreds of years and even today have very different
meanings about "what is against god" this statement can never be
considered anything else but an opinion and a wish (or a joke, but
that doesn't belong here). 

BTW: I think that demo1.ogg of ZynAdd sounds very New-Age-ish in my
ears. ;)

Hello list,

I successfully installed the Planet CCRMA CDs with all the applications on. However, I am desperate for one application called MIX (9-channel mixer from NoTAM)ported for Linux by Guenter Geiger. The reason is that I have done several pieces under that program in the University (on Unix System) and now being away of the University I cannot access them any more...

So far I tried the RPM from Planet CCRMA and the tarball from ftp://xdv.org/pub/gige/mix with lesstif lib included but the program opens with a couple of warnings;
"Warning: Cannot convert string "flat_foreground" to type SliderVisual" "Warning: No font found." and then crashes after I add some sounds. Some times it gives immediate segfault.

I would be very greatfull if any of you do run MIX without major problems under RH9, Planet CCRMA.

In fact all I want is to be able to load the files back and play them. I don't want the effects and the processing tools. I don't even want to record through that. 
 
I would very much appreciate your help.
 
 
Thanks, Panayiotis

Just to 'second' the idea, I too miss arcane old Mix as a simple, fast,
daily-use mixing/submixing app.  I realize that for most Ardour is the
logical tool, but there is still, IMHO, a need for a lightweight mixer
for quick submmixing in Linux.  The process of importing/exporting,
"project" creating, etc is just too cumbersome for this application.

Of those with promise I would site these:

Mix (ran under MDK 9, segfaults in RH 9 after clean rebuild)
Rt (Doug Scott's port)
MixMagic (runs, but no development for some time)
Audacity

...any others?  I currently use Rt and even Csound for basic submixing.

Anyone else interested in Seeing Mix  live again?  I would be
interested in helping out.

Greetings

I've got just back on this list after a year of lurking and learning more
Linux. The audio software is developing amazingly, so I finally took the
plunge and ordered an RME Hammerfall DSP Digiface and a couple of Frontier
Tango24 A/D convertors, when I noticed a bargain at Turnkey in London (UK).

So I'll at last be entering a world of sound, to edit a few years worth of
DAT tapes, instead of sitting here in silence listening to my PC fans (well,
my CD player too!).

I'm running Debian on a few Pentium III 450MHz machines I've got here; I'd
been planning to get a dual Athlon system but decided to wait (forever? :)
until they are cool enough to run quietly. For the time being I just need
to edit stereo and 4-track recordings, so 450MHz should do.

I really welcome the advice you guys have poured into this list, and am
looking forward to joining in the banter, instead of sitting on the fence.

Yes, I suggest *not* building Mix with OpenMotif. IIRC the default build
for OM is a Motif 2.x version. Mix will build with that version but it
segfaults. I've not bothered debugging it at all under Motif 2.0, I just
rebuilt it using Lesstif 1.x and it runs fine for me. I suppose it's
worthwhile to eventually debug it under Motif 2.x but I just don't have
the time now. :(

I'm using an RME Digi96/8 PAD and I'm trying to configure ALSA so that when JACK loads it will provide transports to both the stereo device and the ADAT device on the card. I think the proper way to do this is by creating a virtual multi device but I can't find much info other than just an example on how to set it up. The multi device is easy enough to figure out, but I'm not quite sure how to set up the interleaved PCM stream correctly, the example given on the ALSA website is for a 4 channel setup and I need to set one up for 10 channels.

Here's my current .asoundrc:

pcm.rme_stereo {
	type hw
	card 0
	device 0
}

ctl.rem_stereo {
	type hw
	card 0
	device 0
}

pcm.rme_adat {
	type hw
	card 0
	device 1
}

ctl.rme_adat {
	type hw
	card 0
	device 1
}

pcm.multi {
	type multi;
	slaves.a.pcm rme_stereo;
	slaves.a.channels 2;
	slaves.b.pcm rme_adat;
	slaves.b.channels 8;
	bindings.0.slave a;
	bindings.0.channel 0;
	bindings.1.slave a;
	bindings.1.channel 1;
	bindings.2.slave b;
	bindings.2.channel 0;
	bindings.3.slave b;
	bindings.3.channel 1;
	bindings.4.slave b;
	bindings.4.channel 2;
	bindings.5.slave b;
	bindings.5.channel 3;
	bindings.6.slave b;
	bindings.6.channel 4;
	bindings.7.slave b;
	bindings.7.channel 5;
	bindings.8.slave b;
	bindings.8.channel 6;
	bindings.9.slave b;
	bindings.9.channel 7;
}

ctl.multi {
	type hw;
	card 0;
}



Also, if there is a better/easier way to do this please tell me.

Hi,

I am trying latencytest-0.42-png.tar.gz for measuring latency on my 
Apple G3 (Debian/Sid PowerPC). Of course I am enabling USE_GENERIC_TIMER 
and tuning my hard disk using hdparam before tests. But, results show a 
very poor performance. Indeed, any X11 stressing involves a raise of the 
latency and lots of dropouts.

I can't blame hardware. Apple hardware is top-class, and this same 
machine features under 1,5 ms of latency using CoreAudio on Mac OS X. 
So, whether the PowerPC kernel or X11 are not fully optimized, or the 
latencytest application is not reliable on non-Intel platforms.

Any ideas?

Sorry for crossposting... ;)

First of all, you mentioned in another post that you use x11perf to
create X11 stress. Are there also problems with real world apps?

Also keep in mind that neither the vanilla 2.4 kernel nor the X server
were designed for low latency. Have you tried the low latency and/or
O(1) scheduler kernel patches, and not running the X server with
negative nice values if you are?

Last but possibly not least of all, the dmasound driver has been less
prone to dropouts in my experience than the ALSA driver.

"Real world" apps work properly (except for the Gnome theme manager 
which displays garbage). I only find video performance using Linux a lot 
lower than using any of the Mac OS's.


Both of those patches (A. Morton and R. Love's ones) were applied to my 
kernel. I don't know about running the X server with different nice 
values, which advantage would I get? (I am using gdm as my X session 
manager).


I should try with pure OSS. Let's not forget that the latency test suite 
is using the OSS compatibility layer of ALSA.

Thanks a lot. Any feedback is still very useful.

Hello. Welcome. I'm fairly new here too but have already got some great
advice and now my system is runing well and performing great.

If you are just doing simple editing, I would highly recommend Audacity.
It doesn't need all the low-latency stuff to get going and can do
multitrack with ALSA support. Should be fine for 4 tracks.

Awesome.


Here is where I _highley_ recommend the program 'sweep'.  No offense to the 
authors of audacity, but I just find it to be a very clunky program to use.  
Sweep is very very similar to the program 'soundforge' on win32.  It has 
recently been jackified thanks to Torbin Hohn (thanks Torbin!).  You have to 
download his patches to sweep which you can find on the linux-audio-dev 
mailing list.  Anyway, here is the link to sweep:

Probably a GTK bug, not related to this thread. The point is real world
as opposed to synthetic throughput benchmarks like x11perf.


Which isn't very surprising, as they can use parts of the graphics chip

Beware that at least the low latency patch needs fiddling with
arch/ppc/config.in to actually be enabled (check with grep LOLAT
.config), and that the preempt patch (which I assume you mean by R.
Love's) actually made things worse for me when I tried it on PPC a while
ago. This may have been fixed in the meantime though.

The X server might take less CPU away from other processes. Or maybe the
problem is the other way around. :) YMMV.

the effective editing of large soundfiles or sessions unless you
have a ton of memory (or it will swap all over you).  For smaller
files, like a single stereo song, it works great.

What's the best/easiest/cheapest way to connect one or more keyboards to
a laptop? My own plans was one of the USB-keyboards, but:

*How well is USB-MIDI supported under linux in general?
*Which keyboards is known to work under linux?
*Is the response faster than with MIDI?

I have an m-audio uno that works quite well. I assume that
the multi-port USB products work just as well and the keyboards
with builtin USB are the same thing. The only issue was setting
up the firmware, but there is some decent documentation on the
alsa site.

Hallo,

o

In general quite good. That is, because in general USB audio and midi
has to follow a know specification, to that it is relatively easy to
use on driver for several devices. But that is so only in theory in
real lifethe manufactureres don't always follow the specs fully.=20


I have the M-Audio Oxygen and it works. Also Edirol keyboards
reportedly work fine.


No, I don't think so.

Most devices are supported.


All USB MIDI keyboards from Evolution, Roland/Edirol, and Yamaha.

supported, and the driver setup of these keyboards is slightly more
complicated.


A typical MIDI command uses three bytes; at 31250 kbps, these are
transmitted in about one millisecond. USB uses a much higher data
rate, but all communication is packed into frames which have a length
of one millisecond. It is possible to send more than MIDI command in
one frame, however.

Yes. Both from a practical p.o.v. and theoretical. Dominic (one of the
authors of audacity) has a paper about it in Computer Music Journal 26(2)
pp 62--76.

Try loading a GB file into sweep and audacity and you will see the
difference immediatly.

Well, unless I am mistaken, a user with normal privileges (non-root) cannot 
disable paging of memory (using mlock() stuff).  So, im not exactly sure what 
sweep does to gaurantee it is only using physical memory, if that is indeed 
what it is doing.  Perhaps the sweep author can shed some light on what is 
going on. 

So yes, as a root user there is definitly a significant difference in how 
memory is managed if the program utilizes the mlock() system call.  It is 
garaunteed a range of memory will not be swapped out to disk.

As a non-root user, I do not believe there is anyway to know what is currently 
swapped to disk and what is not, so the question you ask then becomes moot.

If I am mistaken im sure someone will point it out =)

I wouldn't regard this as a downside - it's just a consequence of the 
in-RAM design. Sweep and Audacity (which is a hard disk recorder) 
complement each other very well.

You wouldn't use Audacity for real-time scratching effects, or 
scrubbing through a file to find an edit point by ear. You wouldn't 
use Sweep for recording four channels of 32-bit float audio for half 
an hour or longer. But I've done these things with the other program, 
with great sucess.

A killer feature of free software is that you don't have to choose a 
single proprietary 'solution', which will usually be a design 
compromise - you get to use both Sweep and Audacity, and many other 
programs, depending on what you need at that moment. 

Cheers

Sure. Only I remember having installed Mandrake 9.1, and I think video 
performance was somewhat better. Maybe I am wrong and memory cheats...


You're right! First line in the patch file says:

arch/i386/config.in         |    3 +

So the patch to the config.in file is only applied automatically for the 
i386 architecture. Indeed CONFIG_LOLAT_SYSCTL was not in my .config, so 
should I paste this manually into arch/ppc/config.in? Would this be enough?

And about the preempt, patch, well, it seems I still have enough tests 
to perform so I can spend my holydays safely.

BEAST/BSE version 0.5.4 is available for download at:

  ftp://beast.gtk.org/pub/beast/v0.5
or
  http://beast.gtk.org/beast-ftp/v0.5

BEAST (the Bedevilled Audio SysTem) is a graphical front-end to
BSE (the Bedevilled Sound Engine), a library for music composition,
audio synthesis, MIDI processing and sample manipulation.
The project is hosted at:

  http://beast.gtk.org


This new development series of BEAST comes with a lot of
the internals redone, many new GUI features and a sound
generation back-end separated from all GUI activities.

The most outstanding new features are the track editor which allowes
for easy selection of synthesizers or samples as track sources, loop
support and unlimited UnDo/ReDo capabilities.

Note, the .bse file format hasn't fully stabilized yet, so
incompatibilities with future versions may occur, though we're
making every possible attempt to maintain backwards compatibility.

Overview of Changes in BEAST/BSE 0.5.4:

* Ported and improved synthesis module from David A. Bartold:
  DavSynDrum - Synthetic drum generator
* Added support for control event editing
* Added per-note velocity and fine-tune editing
* Added support for per-track and per-song special effects
* Some GUI polishing
* Fixes to compile on NetBSD
* Miscellaneous bug fixes

Hi,
   I was on vacation for a few days or I might have jumped in a bit earlier
on this. I will only point out that this exact discussion has come up every
time Paul puts out a new release of his software. I don't know whether the
folks here do not search the archives, or whether they forget this clause
from release to release, as I sometimes do, but this is all covered ground.

   My (personal, not legal) reading of this is that it's really up to the
user to decide what he's doing. I (personally, not legally) agree with you
and do not think that when I play new age music, or shred a bit with my
guitar, that I'm making music against God and Jesus Christ. If someone else
does, then they should not use the software, or they could use it and
understand that they may be in violation of Paul's license, thus risking a
suit from Paul.

   I (personally, not legally) think Paul has the right to make any
additional restrictions to the use of his software that he sees fit. This is
his software. I support his right to do this, and I'm not even a regular
attendee of any religious institution.

   Anyway, asked and answered many times over the last year.

With best reards,
Mark

This is a good point, I didn't really mean it as a deficiency, just
a usage caveat.

If Conrad does update it to stream from disk, he might
consider it an option in addition to the current practice (so no usage advantages
are compromised).

Fluid3=20

Does anybody know where to get this Fluid III font? I have been looking =

are lots of links to thesoundsite.net but that site seems to be defunct =
and Hammersound is a ghost town. I was able to get ahold of the MEGA =
Sound Bank v2.50 and it works quite well as a GS/GM sound font.

You can get it at www.jchyun.com/~afterdan/MegaV25.rar

If anyone knows where I can get the other two please let me know.

Maybe we should see if gentoo would host these major sound fonts in =
portage...

-Reuben

-->><<--__-->><<--

Coupla quick points:  The 8mbgssfx.sf2 and 8mbgmgs.sf2 soundfonts are 
also quite high quality and a nice size.  The Hammersound site is your 
friend.

Also, sfArkXTc.exe runs just fine under Wine for expanding sfArk files 
such as the excellent fluidr3.sfArk soundfont.

Just began using Swami this week and I cleaned out some dead wood wave 
samples from my favorite fonts, and discovered this app does a nice job 
of splitting and merging soundfonts.  Very nice program!

Finally, loading multiple soundfonts into fluidsynth and then importing 
and merging the font banks in Rosegarden really makes using multiple 
instrument voices from multiple soundfont sets a piece of cake, or as 
some might say a Cakewalk.

For those fortunate enough with bandwidth:

http://inanna.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~swh/fluid-unpacked/







-->><<--__-->><<--

I have both, and in principle I have the bandwidth to send them to 
anyone who wants, but I don't have anything like enough hosting space 
to actually host them and I really don't feel like clogging up the 
world's email servers with this sort of stuff.  I guess the answer is 
one of the filesharing systems, but I haven't a clue how they work (I 
prefer not to get involved with this technology stuff if I can help it, 
you understand) and really the thought doesn't tempt me.

One problem I have with these soundfonts, and with the idea of getting 
free-software repositories to host them, is that it's very hard to know 
that what you're getting really is redistributable.  Many of these 
soundfonts (I have no idea about Fluid) are made up largely of samples 
of existing synths: what exactly is the copyright situation with those?  
If it's iffy, how can I know whether a soundfont contains such samples 
or not?  It's very rare to see any statement from the author/compiler 
of the font about the status of the samples.  This question comes up 
quite frequently (though maybe a little less often than the one about 
ZynAddSubFX licensing) and I haven't ever seen a very satisfactory 
answer.

That said, I'm not especially keen on Fluid myself anyway.  I find the 
balance of the acoustic instruments is a bit unpredictable.

One completely different set of soundfonts I will recommend is Bree 
Gorton's (Gort's Synth, Gort's Mini Piano etc) available at 
hammersound.net.  There are some groovy and generally peculiar sounds 
in there, made up of very small generator sets and thus packed into 
absolutely tiny soundfonts (the largest I have is 78K, the smallest 3K, 
and they're full sets of 256 or so instruments).  Of course you need a 
rather particular aesthetic to enjoy that kind of thing, but they're a 
very clever construction.

Hallo,


Althogh I do have a Soundblaster in my machine, I actually prefer
fluidsynth. Not because of the sound quality - where fluidsynth is
still a bit challenged  -, but because of the added flexibility a
software-solution can provide. Using a Soundblaser card in a
Jack-centric setup is at least a bit awkward, and using it inside my
favourite soft-synth, Pd, is quite impossible. Fluidsynth OTOH was
very easily ported to live inside Pd as an external. 

So it very much depends on the way you work.

I think low latency and preempt patches are backported on 2.4
and installed by default on desktop installations
in mainstream distros such as Mandrake and RedHat.

Very well. I have rebooted only once, after a 15 day uptime, when an rmmod of a
SCSI driver module did not return (but no freeze of the kernel itself). So as
far as I can see, it is very stable. It is not the latest 2.5.72, but I would
say that in general things have only improved since then.

As for audio, first of all it is very nice to have ALSA included, and as far
low latency/responsiveness, I can only see that it "feels" good. I have not
run any of the stress tests though, but under a normal workload, I get no 
underruns. What is more, with 2.4.20 I had, even with the LL en PE patches,
some problems with underruns and X getting slugish during heavy disk access.
I suppose the 2.5.72 kernel has better support for the IDE DMA on my mainboard.

Actually I'm asking for experiences with 2.5 because I'm writing an

should cover the 2.5-series in more depth than just saying: "2.5 has
better latency built in, but use it only if you know what you're
doing". But then, maybe instead of explaining how to patch the
2.4-kernel, I could just say: "install 2.5 and enable ALSA. Now on to
installing Jack..." ;)

AFAIK, alsa in 2.6 is the very latest.
Updates happen in the mainline kernel tree, as alsa is accepted.

Hi there,

I bought a used emi 6|2m from Emagic. It has 6 inputs and 2 outputs. But
I found no linux-driver/kernel-module for that device. There is a kernel
module for the emi 2|6 but it does not work for the 6|2m.

Has someone experiences with that device under linux? Please tell me.

Thx,

Martin

Nothing to do with audio, but you should have a copy of the knoppix
disk.  If you ever try to buy computers or do anything on a non-linux
computer, it lets you use linux to do it with.

actually, you'll probably have to get 'module-init-tools' for modules to load properly under 2.5/2.6. It sits alongside the old 2.4 one, and doesn't cause any problem with older kernels.

The other problem I've had is that when trying to use devfsd with the 2.5/2.6 kernel, permissions on some of the /dev nodes are set wrong causing all sorts of problems trying to run stuff. I've generally found it better to not use devfs with 2.5/2.6 for now ..

A patch is also available for the nvidia closed-source drivers at http://www.minion.de/ to allow building against 2.5/2.6.

otherwise, I've been using the 2.6 kernel a fair bit and have been having very good experiences. I've noticed some audio stuttering in neverwinter nights using an audigy2 w/ alsa that I never experienced with 2.4, but generally 2.5/2.6 feels faster.

Hallo,


Install ALSA and use the snd-usb-audio module. Should work out of the

Thank you, Frank!

I insmodded snd-usb-audio but lsmod says, it is unused.

I am an absolute beginner concerning multichannel recording.

I do not even know how to recognize if it really works. I tried
audacity, but it looks to me that it only knows 2-channel recording. But
it doesn't even record with them with the emi 6|2m-box (which is ok,
because the module is unused).

How can I make it work?

Please tell me.

You need version 1.1.3 or later for multichannel. It's reliable up to

module-init-tools will move the respective tools from modutils out of the way
by renaming them to "*.modutils" 

Modules are now configured in /etc/modprobe.conf and /etc/modprobe.d/*, 
'update-modules' will build /lib/modules/modprobe.conf out of these.

When changing your 2.4.x config in /etc/modutils/* you now need to run 
'update-modules.modutils' to build /etc/modules.conf.

Well, the issue with the Emagic cards is that they are not USB
Audio-compliant when initially powered on, the only thing it can do is to
receive a "soft" firmware from the host computer, and this firmware handles
the USB Audio interface (the USB interface chip that Emagic uses has this
loader functionality built in, and it's easier to have the driver supply the
firmware than to have it stored in flash memory in the Emagic box). I use
the 2|6 myself (more or less the reverse of yours, two inputs and 6 outputs,
no midi though), and that card has got it's firmware loader built into the
later kernels (late 2.4, all 2.5), but I haven't seen anything about the
6|2m... Ofcourse there has to be a different firmware loaded - this will
have to be supplied from Emagic (see http://www.vtoy.fi/~tapio/emi26.html
for the text about 2|6. When there's firmware out it would be trivial to add
that to the same Emagic loader code already in the kernel for the 2|6..

I really like the 2|6, down to 64-sample periods even with all 8 channels
driven (44.1kHz 16-bit * 6 output and 44.1kHz 16-bit input * 2).

Hallo,


Hm, maybe unplugging helps? Is it your only or the first device? Then
you could try to play with "aplay -D default some.wav" even if the
module is "unused". 


You might need to use an ~/.asoundrc. I use the one with my M-Audio
Quattro, that is available on alsa-project.org, probably there is a
similar one for the EMI, too. But stereo should work without one.

Yes. I believe Audacity only loads the graphical waveform view into RAM 
and the rest is streamed from disk. Dominic
Mazonni (audacity's lead developer) explained the exact algorithm once 
on the dev list, ending the sentence with "...and a little black magic" 
so I assume the algorithm is a bit complicated.

I have opened and worked on files over two hours long in Audacity.

Hi,

I've been trying to compile csound on and off for the past two years and
was never really successful: the closest I ever got to a working csound
was a binary which would segfault every other run. So I gave it another
try yesterday and again ran across some difficulties.

Everything goes well enough until the linking stage at which point the
whole things gives up and starts spewing messages such as this one:
main.o(.text+0x341): In function `csoundMain': undefined reference to `POLL_EVENTS'

Now, it appears that POLL_EVENTS is somehow related to graph generation;
the problem is that I don't have any GUI installed on my system and
therefore don't want to have anything to do with FLTK, TCLTK or X11, and
it seems to be responsible for my problems. My question is: has anyone
ever successfully built csound without the graph generation pieces? Any
hint would be greatly appreciated.

-->><<--__-->><<--

I've never been there, but do they record commercial clients, or were 
they built just for research and university music projects? Any 
tip-offs would be welcome.

The relevance of Ron's studio to SoS readers is that it might be 
similar to the medium-sized independent studios they are used to 
working in. The difference being Linux, of course...  

Thanks

I'd imagine they dont record commercial clients, but Fernando would be hte
person to ask. I though you were just looking for examples of linux being
used "for real".
 

Sure, its obviously a good example.

- Steve



-->><<--__-->><<--

Fortunately we have plenty of those!

The interesting thing about recording commercial clients (who are 
paying by the hour to be there) is that the technology has to be 
absolutely dependable - the client won't be interested in excuses if 
it doesn't work. It's therefore a bit different from using it on your 
own material, where workarounds and fixes are all part of the 
learning curve.

there, but not quite ready. He's got high hopes for it though - and 
by the time this article comes out (probably November issue or later) 
we may well have ironed out those bugs. I personally hope to give it 
a go shortly with the M Audio 1010, because we haven't been able to 
get Audacity to do more than 5 simultaneous inputs to distinct tracks 
so far.   

Cheers

Daniel



-->><<--__-->><<--

Ardour seems to handle volume fine, though there are still a few glitch
bugs to iron out in beta2.

- Steve



-->><<--__-->><<--

That's why they call it a beta! I'm careful not to exaggerate the 
maturity of the Linux-based audio apps, when programs like Cubase 
have had 15 years (or whatever) of development.

But at least the underlying system is stable - although we've had some 
beta application crashes in the studio, I don't think I've ever had 
to do a forced reboot or lost any saved data. There are plenty of 
people still trying to make music on Windows 98...

Hello.

I am something of an old-school rocker, not so much of a 
digital-techno-looper (although that stuff sounds fun too).  I am 
curious to hear how you guitarists out there handle your sound.  Do you 
all go direct in now?  Or do some of you still mic your cabnet?  I still 
have not gotten my system together because of extenuating circumstances, 
so I am still of the old school (namely, tape).  When last I tried 
(about 10 years ago) there was no good (and affordable) way to go 
direct.  Has that problem been solved in the modern Linux recording world?

My friend recently purchased an "all-in-one" unit from Roland, a 24 
track 24 bit digital recorder, that cost him about $2,500 I think 
(excluding cabling, mics etc).  He says he goes direct -- and not only 
direct but totally clean.  All effects, including distortion are added 
after the fact. He goes from his guitar into his recorder!  This sure 
seems strange to me, although I can understand the logic there.  Is this 
what you guys do?

I would love to hear how you all handle this.  :0)


Thanks!

Chris

<snip>

Well, for a couple years I was able to do recording with my old Soundblaster 
but that was very limiting, one channel in, not much luck with full-duplex 
(recording while playing a previously recorded track). I bit the bullet and 
bought an M-Audio Delta 44 (about $250 last year I believe) and a Behringer 
project mixer.

Since I can't really even turn my guitar amp on in my apartment (Mesa/Boogie 
has 2 volumes - off and *LOUD*) I do most of my project recording plugged 
through an effects pedal, such as:

guitar --> fx pedal --> mixer --> Delta44 --> PC

I've also done a fair amount of live tracking (mic'd amps) with this same rig. 
It sounds great. For the neophyte PC recorder I suggest Audacity 
(audacity.sourceforge.net) as it has a very lightweight learning curve. I've 
done a great deal of multi-track recording with it. There are quite a few 
Linux apps for multitrack recording (notably Ardour) but Audacity was the 
easiest one to get started with. A drum machine helps too. It allows me to 
write songs, record the skeletons, mail them (on CD) to people I play with 
who are 2 hours away, meet up with them and play, then do proper mix-down of 
all the live tracked material afterwards. All with Slackware, ALSA and 
Audacity.

Several of my friends have the all-in-one recording rigs (like the Roland you 
mention above) but I like the PC solution - it's much more flexible. YMMV.

<snip>

As I mentioned in my previous post, since I can't really use my amp in my 
apartment, I use an FX pedal that has a great rectifier-emulation setting for 
distortion and/or repugnantly titanic crunch. Whenever we get together to do 
'real' recording (a friend has about 10 acres, we can make all the noise we 
want) I mic my amps at a decently (or indecently, depending on your viewpoint 
;-) loud level and play/record 2 separate tracks, one for each side in 
stereo, maybe more, time permitting. Plugging direct actually works pretty 
well for the rhythm tracks, but not all that great for leads. I really dig 
the warm, feedbacky sound I get from my Boogie tube amp and it can *not* be 
replaced by an fx pedal.

So, to answer your question, at home I play quite a bit plugged into my PC 
through an FX pedal and use the monitors (plugged into my mixer) as my amp. 
Once I have my own house and a proper studio where I can shake the walls all 
I want, I'll probably stop plugging in direct and mic my amps.

That said, I record tracks for people all the time with my fx pedal, convert 
them to wav and send them off on the internet for them to use as they see 
fit. Direct does have it's uses, but for a metalhead or hard rock fan I can't 
see the use in playing clean into a PC and then adding effects. If it's not 
crunchy while I'm playing, I'm not entertained, but of course that is 
completely arbitrary. I have a few jazz/blues playing friends who do all 
their recording clean.

JB



-->><<--__-->><<--

I don't wire my guitar or bass directly into my Roland external USB sound 
thingy, though I probably could.  I run them through one of a couple cheap 
DSP amp simulators I have, I think made by Boss.  I was previously using a 
direct box or just plugging in and always ran into one problem or another.  
Noise, ground hum, bad levels, whatever.  It may be that the Roland thingy 
would eliminate those problems (previously I was also going straight into a 
PC sound card) but I guess I've gotten used to the imaginary amp thing.

I would say I'm more of a keyboardist who uses guitars for effect than an 
actual guitarist though, so maybe there are downsides I haven't thought of.

Hi,
   Hi. I asked this question on Alsa-Dev yesterday, but 17 hours later got
no answers. Excuse me to those that subscribe to both lists.

   This info is to help me do more debug work on a new HDSP 9652 driver
version that I am helping to test.

   Should the volume levels I hear when using the command

aplay -Dplughw:0 -r 44100 data/wave/seque~10.wav

be controlled by alsamixer?

The volumes for alsaplayer are being controlled by alsamixer, but this aplay
command is not, at least right now on a new driver I'm using.

   Also, on a multichannel card, how do I direct the above aplay command to
a specific channel? I am finding that with this new driver the audio is
appearing on ALL channels on the card, even for a mono wave file. I think
this is a bug, but I'm not sure.

   If there's an explanation fit for a simpleton like me about the
difference between plughw and hw and when to use one vs. the other, please
point me there so I can learn. I have read a bit on the Alsa site about
plughw talking directly to the kernel, but beyond that I have not discovered
any documentation yet.

   Thanks in advance.

Cheers,
Mark

Crunchy licks don't "feel right" if they're played without overdrive, don't 
they?

I had some horrible latency with my old Microbloat system once. Playing guitar 
through that setup was impossible.

I plugged the guitar into my mixer and routed the signal into the PC as well 
as into a distortion pedal and my amplifier. I didn't tune that amp chain 
much to make it sound exciting, but at least there was no latency with that 
crunchy "monitor". It worked quite well actually, the clean signal that I 
recorded got its overdrive and other effects afterwards. 

I came across that idea when a friend of mine showed me his bi-amp guitar 
rack. Most of his overdrive sounds use a clean setting of the second amp.

A little amount of clean signal can add a lot of punchy attack to distorted 
guitars, but it's not that easy to mix the two signals smoothly.

Absolutely true. I play the guitar differently with a crunchy sound vs. a
clean sound. I pick differently. My fret board fingers move differently. If
I play the guitar 'cleanly' and then add crunchy effects, I don't get the
same product.

I do, however, record direct using a Pod Pro with a crunchy sound, and by
the time things are mixed down it seems quite acceptable to me. There's
nothing magic about the Pod Pro. All the same programs could, presumably, be
run with host-based processing as a LADSPA plugin, presuming that CPU cycles
and latency don't cause you problems. I haven't had much need (nor
opportunity) to experiment with such things under Linux.

Cheers,
Mark

I have recorded into my system (DSP 2000 C-Port) using an effects pedall and it sounds OK but if I'm serious about it I use my tube amp with a pair of condeser mics.  You can't get the "tube sound" out of an effects pedal (unless it's a tube pedal and even then it's 12AX7 not EL84/6L6GC/5881 sound).  The boost in the even harmonics caused by tubes just hasn't been emulated (to my ears anyway).  Maybe someday.

Hello.

I am something of an old-school rocker, not so much of a 
digital-techno-looper (although that stuff sounds fun too).  I am 
curious to hear how you guitarists out there handle your sound.  Do you 
all go direct in now?  Or do some of you still mic your cabnet?  I still 
have not gotten my system together because of extenuating circumstances, 
so I am still of the old school (namely, tape).  When last I tried 
(about 10 years ago) there was no good (and affordable) way to go 
direct.  Has that problem been solved in the modern Linux recording world?

My friend recently purchased an "all-in-one" unit from Roland, a 24 
track 24 bit digital recorder, that cost him about $2,500 I think 
(excluding cabling, mics etc).  He says he goes direct -- and not only 
direct but totally clean.  All effects, including distortion are added 
after the fact. He goes from his guitar into his recorder!  This sure 
seems strange to me, although I can understand the logic there.  Is this 
what you guys do?

I would love to hear how you all handle this.  :0)


Thanks!

Chris

To be fair, buffer overflow exploits can happen just as easily in Linux
or any other OS. This isn't an area where Linux is inherently more
secure than Windows, except that in *n*x the scope for damage is more
limited if the compromised program in question runs as an unpriviliged
user.

Hello all,

I am completely certain that what I am about to ask has been asked a million 
times. But I am also rather tired of searching for answers for these things, 
and I've been looking around on and off for something like a year. This list 
is my best shot so far, so please excuse my ignorance and my laziness to keep 
looking all by myself. Next to this mail I have another question, but I 
decided to put that into its own mail to reduce confusion.

Quick description of what I WANT to do:
Compose music on my Linux system, playback MIDI files.

What I HAVE done in the past:
I've composed midis in windows for pretty much as long as I can remember. 
Starting on an AdLib card, I have never bought myself any other hardware than 
soundcards. I composed in MIDI only, using JazzWare (www.jazzware.com), which 
I would be able to get for Linux as well of course.

What I HAVE in my computer right now is a Terratec DMXFire 1024. I assume I 
will not be able to use the samples on that card according to what I've read 
so far. I would *like* to keep composing in MIDI format, since I know that 
pretty well by now. I realize I will probably need a software synth or 
something like that and need to get myself patches from somewhere, and I have 
found a number of pages online, but have been totally unable to find some 
sort of VERY basic FAQ. 

So exactly what do I need.. is MIDI the way to go at all still or should I 
consider learning some other format (probably using some tracker like 
software.. a finnish friend of mine exclusively uses Impulse Tracker on his 
win box)? What Software Synth (if that is the name of the thing I will need) 
will I need, what can you recommend? It would of course be best for all if 
someone could just point me to a general FAQ and tell me to read the fabulous 
manual. 

Right now I'm also running ALSA 0.5.. there is some version of esound on my 
computer as well. Things are rather confused, but my other mail will be on 
that topic. 

Thank you in advance for your patience and more importantly, your answers.

Daniel

The practical difference is that Linux users tend to patch theoretical 
exploits, where as Windows users usually only get round to security 
updates once real damage is being done, and not even then sometimes.

I've known plenty of organisations that have suffered real damage from 
Windows exploits, either lost data or significant downtime.

But probably the greatest exploit is human ignorance. I know of one 
organisation which I helped arrange a Linux firewall after thousands 
of pounds worth of damage to servers on the LAN from script kiddies.

Following up later, I found the sysadmin had been ordered to remove 
the firewall by senior management - because one of them had a tantrum 
when they found they could no longer access their work PC directly 
from home. The sysadmin tried to explain about VPNs, but the manager 
wasn't interested. "Switch it off now - that's an order!"  

Cheers

Hello,

again, excuse the very basic nature of my question, I should have found these 
answers myself, but I tried long and just couldn't. Maybe the internet as 
such dislikes me.

I want to do something very basic. Basically that is let multiple programs 
talk to my soundcard at the same time. Simple example: XMMS is playing a 
song, someone on IRC uses a keyword to page me, my XChat perl script calls 
some form of command line mp3/wav playback program and plays a sound that 
gets my attention. Or XMMS is playing and I access a webpage with a Flash 
animation. Or the aforementioned paging situation happens while watching a 
movie with mplayer. Currently, none of those are possible to me. I must say I 
am very ignorant in this area still, am really willing to educate myself but 
find myself unable to find anything BASIC on this. A little FAQ on basic 
terminology would be grand already. What do you call things like ALSA, Esound 
and what not? How does stuff like KDE's aRts fit in?

Anyway, I am running ALSA 0.5. I have tried to upgrade to an ALSA 0.9x once, 
but I remember faintly there were serious problems, so I tried to circumvent 
that upgrade for the time being. Will an ALSA 0.9x version offer me this 
functionality of multiple sound sources at the same time? I used esound once 
too, while I'm absolutely foggy as to how that worked. I installed it, told 
XMMS to talk to esound and then used a play utility that came along with 
esound. That's how I solved the XMMS is playing + notify sound from XChat 
should play situation. But esound seems to have the latency of a really tired 
old man, and that looked plain retarded with the little visualization window 
of XMMS. I know I know, not the end of the world, but other programs also 
didn't like to talk to esound (including mplayer). Will I need to upgrade to 
ALSA 0.9 then? Is that the standard right now? What other options do I have?

Again, if you can just point me to a general FAQ about all this, please by any 
means do so. 

Many thanks,

Daniel

Daniel,
   A quick response:

1) Check out Rosegarden. It's a very nice MIDI environment. Or go with
Jazzware, although I think development on that has ceased.

2) Upgrade to a newer version of Alsa if you're going to do this at all.

3) If you're new to Linux, consider one of the prepackaged environments that
supports a specific distribution. If you're interested in Redhat, then go
the PlanetCCRMA site for most everything you need. For other distributions
others here will give you guidance.
http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/

4) Don't be totally sure you can't use your existing samples. If they are
Sound Font based, there are Sound Font tools under Linux. Two favs are Swami
and Fluid Synth.

5) Lots of good soft synths coming along here, and the price is right, at
least monetarily. Try our amSynth and ZynAddSubFx as your more standard user
interface models, and then things like Spiral Synth Modular and many others
for you're more daring endeavors. ;-)

6) If you like MIDI, stick with MIDI. Trackers are fun. Some of the Windows
ones will run under Wine, should you want to mess with a mixed environment a
bit, but that's quite challenging.

Good luck,
Mark

Indeed. I'm running gentoo on my main box for a few months now.

Regarding kernel patches, with just a little grepping in the portage 
tree I was able to glean the following info...


source			latency-related info
------- 		---------------------
ck-sources		"in general his kernels are known to be VERY 
			 low latency." 
			 doesn't say what patches are contained, but
			 based on notes in other sources, I guess
			 LL, PE, and O(1)

gaming-sources		ebuild contains a URL of a page that tells all:
			http://members.optusnet.com.au/ckolivas/kernel/
			... at which you can see it contains LL, PE, 
			and O(1) among other things.
			Also read the FAQ, it mentions some notable bugs
			e.g. hdparm is broken at least with gaming-sources
			for 2.4.21:
			http://members.optusnet.com.au/ckolivas/kernel/#faq


gentoo-sources		"Based heavily on ck-sources-2.4.20-r2..."
			contains LL,PE,O(1)

gs-sources  		contains LL, PE

gentoo-hardened		- ck7-base (O(1), preempt, low latency)

mm-sources		This is for 2.5/2.6 kernels, which I have not
			really paid attention to. Contains some patches
			from Andrew Morton.

wolf-sources		"replaced:LowLatency in favor of lowlatency 
			 fixes from latest -AA"


Note that you still have to pay attention to configuration options:
e.g. if you don't enable lowlatency and preemptible during kernel
config, the patches might as well not be there :-)

Hi

I'm now 1 small step from getting a laptop for music applications
(mainly live csound, but also some sequencer (muse?), some soft synths
(csound/PD), some sample playback + maybe HD-recording.

I'm looking at 2 machines

a)P4 2.4Ghz, 256Mb RAM, 20Gb HD, 1400x1050
b)P4 2.66Ghz, 512Mb RAM, 40Gb HD, 1024x768

Since I'm comming from AMD K6-300, 256Mb RAM, 8Gb HD, I cannot judge if
a) is gonna be too small for my use? Every salesperson will tell you
that you *have* to have 512Mb RAM, since they're assuming you're running
WinXP, how true is this with linux. I don't see the smaller HD as a big
problem, although the bigger the better...

Any thoughts are appreciated.

Hmm... unless your guitar has active electronics (e.g. it has a battery),
you will get a quiet, dull, lifeless sound if you plug it directly into
a line-level device like a computer audio interface.  A few audio
interfaces (notably some of the USB ones) have an input that is designed
to be used for guitar or bass.  If you don't have one of those, you
need some way to get your guitar up to line level. The common
"professional" approach is to go through a direct box which produces
a microphone-level signal that is then run into a typical mic preamp,
and from *there* you go into the soundcard.

But even when all this is done, you now have a very clean, sparkly,
decidedly non-amp-like tone; to most guitarists, it will sound
horrible :-)  So you need some kind of processing to do the distortion
and frequency shaping and compression that amplifiers & guitar speakers
do. You could either do as Rob does:


hmm... bad direct box?


die-hard guitar enthusiasts are (rightly) skeptical of amp & speaker
simulation, it's not hard to get it to sound pretty close but
it IS really hard to get it 100% there.

Anyway, there are a million amp & speaker simulators on the market
now, from sansamp to the line 6 POD models etc etc.

You could also just use LADSPA effects, either in your recording
app or with an effects-box app like Ecamegapedal or Jack Rack.

hmmm, i'm going to go play with those a bit :-)

256MB will be pleanty for audio recording, but if you're going to do any
soft synth work with things like sound fonts, you'll want and probably use
the 512MB.

You mean assuming I use large soundfonts, right? I'm pretty sure I
couldn't fill up 256MB with samples. That would be my whole sample
library... Well, that might change of course... Hmmm. Right now i would
say that if large soundfonts are my only problem, I'm going for the
smaller machine.

Aren't there any software outthere that works like GigaSampler, that is
a softsampler that can play directly from HD?

BTW: I also asked this in my local LUG and one of the posters was
shocked, and said that he had never sat behind a machine with more than
256 MB RAM. Is the "don't go with less than 512MB, or you'll be sooo
sorry"-speach only for windows users or is there some truth in it for us
linux users also?

true, but they'll probably overcharge for preinstalled RAM.
I just ordered another 256 MB of PC133 ECC sdram for about $40...

2.66 Ghz vs 2.4 GHz is not that big a deal - 10 % difference
even if the performance is linear with MHz (yeah right).

as for disks - if you do much recording you should seriously
consider a second audio-only disk.

Your sample library will almost certainly increase over time.  Which
would you rather do - have to worry about what samples were available,
or just load them all and get on with life? ::-)

You'll also get more benefits - even if you can fit your whole sample
library into 256M, you're loosing that much memory that would otherwise
be used for disk cache.  As a result, your system performance will
suffer.

Definitely, go with less preinstalled and buy the additional RAM module 
separately at a good price.  Just make sure to get the correct variety.

Yes, some laptops can take a second harddrive in one of their
expandable bays.  The other alternative is to get an external
firewire HD, (and a Cardbus firewire interface, if the laptop
does not include it on-board).  I have had good success using
ardour with large track counts from a firewire HD.

-->><<--__-->><<--

no.
but http://linuxsampler.sf.net is probably one to keep your eye on.


really depends on a lot of things.

how many programs do you like to have running simultaneously?
Do you have 10 browser windows open? Kde and Gnome apps will probably use
more than simpler ones.

linux has aggressive caching of hdd in RAM which will drastically
speed up certain operations.

how long do you keep your machine on for? If you leave it on for months
you may run into memory leakage problems with beta software, requiring
more RAM.

you probably dont _need_ more than 256M, but i think a ram upgrade is
pretty good value for money performance upgrade. I'm going to upgrade
to 1GB. But if money is tight you can always start small and upgrade later.

Yet another Gentooer here!

My most favorite kernel tree... Unfortunately there have been some issues with 
XFS on the .21 releases so I stick to 2.4.20-ck6 atm. Very responsive even at 
extreme CPU usage (gcc doing some serious work on a console). Less responsive 
than other low-lat versions when your HDD goes postal on I/O. Pretty stable 
though.
Keep out of version 2.4.20-ck5... it had some bitter issues

gaming is another gentoo spin-off based heavily upon ck-sources (ck == Con 
Kolivas, also author of the contest kernel benchmark)
  


if it's still based on -r2, it's not the most brilliant one. This is one of 
the first ck kernels to implement the "elevator" idea for time slices.


Never tried it... I believe it's the tree gentoo uses for its liveCDs. Which 
means "proven to work on most hardware..." So, if you have issues with other 
preemptive, low-lat kernels, I guess this is the one safe choice.

Ok, this contains the most relevant bits for low latency but I think is 
supposed to concentrate more on security patches.


I avoid experimental kernels like the plague... A bug in the FS handling could 
be devastating for me... Let's see how 2.6.x turns out, although it's rather 
early since there are already some news on failed compiles when using this 
kernel.


Actually it's WOLK: Working Overloaded Linux Kernel. The name says it all... 
Tried it once, back in the days of 2.4.18. You'll have nightmares in the 
night about make menuconfig... There is so much extra stuff in there you 
wouldn't believe. Of course, stability is not one of its strengths and it 
seams that there is a pattern of time-related "entropy" to the kernel. After 
uptimes of > 3 days, things just didn't feel so right. Reboot, and optimal 
performance was back. Wouldn't reccomend it for production (making music 
after all, IS production) unless you DO need some of the extra patches.

Aha, and I thought it was suposed to be cheaper to buy what I need now.
 

Exactly my thoughts. Only were I thinking USB2.0, but I guess they're
not as fast as firewire...

Seems you guys made up my mind:

Screen resolution is hard (!) to buy later. RAM is easy, and recording
and keeping audio rocordings on an external HD would be handy anyways.
I'm gonna go for the 2.4, 256, 20, 1400x1050, assuming the next step
works out: running Knoppix on the sucker tomorrow in the store.

Thanks alot. I'll probably be back soon with more software questions...

Really, if the only cost difference is the cost of the RAM, I'd suggest
going for the larger one. It isn't so much that you are adding 256MB and
you're going to use it. The issue is more that you will use up most of your
256MB running the OS, XFree86 and the audio applications for recording and
the soft synths. After they are all loaded, then you'll load the sound fonts
and find that you've gone beyond 256MB (which is what I used to have) and
need more memory. You won't need it all, but you will likely need more.


Nope. There is one project, the 'Linux Sampler' but there is basically no
visible work taking place TTBOMK. There are also patent issues surrounding
playing samples from hard drives...


It is completely true for Linux audio application machines IMO. I actually
think that when you compare Linux apples to Windows apples the memory usage
isn't really that different. The problem I have with Windows is that there
is no simple way to strip things down and get the stuff you want out of the
system. In Linux, I find that if I load KDE and all the services that
Windows runs, Linux uses similar amounts of memory. What I also find true
about Linux is I can strip everything out and run a very minimalistic
environment and use half the memory, which is a big advantage.

I'm sure I'll get flamed for even suggesting that Windows and Linux are not
that different in this regard, but it's my experience and opinion.

 It always strikes me as strange that people in here suggest Audacity and
 virtually ignore snd. 

 { http://linux.oreillynet.com/pub/a/linux/2001/10/05/snd_partone.html }

 Snd seems more capable to me, uses the same plugins, has an easy 
 interface and is easily {guile http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html } 
 extensible and has more depth {potential depth} 

 I use linux because it's something I can adapt to myself... build on etc...
 snd just suits that a little better for me.

 {Delta 44s do definitely rock though.}




-->><<--__-->><<--
Or maybe there's room for both, based on what your needs, interests and
temperaments are...

I know I'm just a lowly Windows Pro Tools user who keeps trying to use Linux
apps, but every time I've tried Snd it's always seemed so high-maintenance
compared to Audacity, so I've tended to like Audacity. Maybe I've missed the
point, but it feels (to me anyway) like if you don't program you won't enjoy
working with Snd.

I agree that, on the surface Snd does seem like it might, possibly, some day
be more capable overall, but the extra stuff has not proven important enough
to me to warrant the pain of getting over the learn curve. I didn't find the
interface very intuitive, at least for what I needed to do.

I think those of us that are Sound Forge users find Audacity's interface
pretty intuitive. Sound Forge is pretty popular in the Windows world and
Audacity, while not a copy at all, feels pretty similar. Things are done
pretty much the same way and in the same places.

Anyway, I'm not disagreeing with you at all, but just pointing out that
there are some of us who have tried both and like Audacity. I'm not ignoring
Snd. It's just not my cup of tea.

Mark

If I needed to describe the above; how about listening to music from the other side of a styrofoam wall?

We have a pod here and that seems to take care of the impedance mismatching of the guitar output to line in.  It also helps take some of the load off of the computer since the pod has it's own dsp.

In the end, it will never sound exactly like a specific miced guitar amp in a specific location.  But, it will sound like most of the stuff recorded in a lot of studios that we buy on CD.

Some of the direct in/line out guitar dsp boxes aren't that expensive for what they do.  I would suggest going to your local music store and giving them a try.  Find a good electric guitar from their racks, run it into the dsp box, and then into a good mixer.  If they don't have any decent speakers connected to the system, plug a good pair of headphones into the mixer and listen from there.  Some of the dsp boxes have their own headphone outs, but I would suggest the above as you can mix and match guitars and boxes until you find a good price/sound quality in the dsp box.

Hi Daniel!
You should go alsa 0.9, for this try planetccrma for making
the upgrade easy.

Hi Daniel,


Yes, but not recommended... it's hardly developed anymore and it does not 
support all the 'fancy stuff' tm that is and will be coming out of the Linux 
Audio Community.


Okay. With your last remark in mind I'd say that you probably have a rather 
old Linux distribution installed. 
I suggest, rather strongly, that you update to one that is absolutely fresh. 
Buy one or download it off of the net.
Linux distributions are constantly moving targets, every release cycle that 
goes around "shows", partly due to great competition between the major 
Linux-distro players, partly due to great work by the communities (like this 
one, but perhaps not the most important community for distros ;)
Which distro to choose is a tough question. I'd have to say that most people 
choose this with their hearts. 
Distros that I _know_ are used by people here are: Suse, Mandrake, Redhat, 
Debian and AltLinux, there are probably a few more around also.

Myself I use Mandrake, it suits me, I'm sure others can sing their praise 
about the other distros that are in use here.

When you got this nailed you should have good support for new apps and 
especially linux multimedia stuff. Either the multimedia stuff is already 
installed, or it is available to install without too much hassle.

Next up it gets tougher. You mention that you used to compose in jazz in 
Windows, using your soundcard as synthesizer. This is a fairly standard 
setup, infact, it's so generic that it's hard to place any good bets on what 
you should use, especially when you mention trackers as a possible option :).
I mean, trackers are nice, but they're also rather specific (their original 
design came from making music for the actual hardware of the old Amiga to put 
in demos.)

To try and answer some of your questions in a way that I _think_ you mean 
them:

- Yes, midi is still (probably/unfortunately/regretably ...pick your 
favourite(s)) the way to go.

- You should try one of the available midi sequencers that are around, MusE, 
Rosegarden are integrated versions (they try to do both Midi and Audio), 
there are quite a few midi only sequencers also.
(Have a look at http://linux-sound.org/ for lots...)

I'm assuming you don't have any external gear since you didn't use it before? 
Then softsynths are probably the way to go.
Mark suggested (rightfully) amSynth and ZynAddSubFX. You should probably also 
have a look at FluidSynth, since it's a sample-player and then probably 
resembles most your old setup.

--------

To round up:

There are an almost infinite amount of possible ways to compose music, even if 
we disregard from the most experimental types there's still quite a few. I 
think you would have an easier time picking your "right" environment if you 
stick around here and ask a few more questions :).

Robert

This - multiple sounds at the same time - is in linux generally handled by a 
sound server. Arts (and esound) is such an application it will fit your bill 
if the apps you wish to use are able to utilize it.
(there are commandline tools e.g. artsplay that can help you play sounds from 
apps that don't know of arts directly)

There are other ways to solve this also, many newer soundcards support playing 
several streams directly on the soundcard. (e.g SB-Live, (not so new...))

For the cards that don't have this and if you can't use a soundserver there 
_are_ another possiblity, that is alsa. There is supposed to be a new device 
type defined in Alsa that provides this capability, whether it is finished, I 
have no idea.

ALSA 0.9 is anyway a definitive must-upgrade.


Wish I could ;), there is a sound HOWTO somewhere, but I wonder if it's not 
getting very old and of the mark by now...

I mean no disrespect for snd or the people who use it, but to me this is 
rather like saying "it strikes me as strange that people suggest Openoffice 
when they could be using XEmacs".

Both have their places, but the more mainstream computer user (and I know 
people on this list dispute this; I myself have been trying to come up with 
ways to compose music in Perl, but by and large it's the truth) wants the 
word processor that looks like Word or Wordperfect and the waveform editor 
that looks like Cool Edit or Soundforge.

I gather that scriptability (I think with Nyquist and Python) soon will be or 
already is in the development version of Audacity.

Mark,

I don't have any experiences with your hardware and didn't think my 
reply would be of much use to you, but running the exact command you 
post on my cs4236 system produces sound that is under control of 
alsamixer, as does -Dhw:0, so that suggests to me that aplay is directly 
affected by the settings in the mixer.  

Now, some cards do not have a mixer so they should not behave this way, 
as I assume would be the case if there were something wrong with the 
driver for a card that does have a mixer.  In either event I would not 
expect to see controls in amixer or the gamix graphical interface.  If 
you see them and they have no effect that sounds like a malfunction.

Couldn't find any answer to your channel question.  My system does not 
seem to provide a relevant option to explore this further.  I fooled 
around with -c and -I options but could draw no useful conclusions.

hello!

I'm finishing up installing Alsa drivers on my Red Hat 9 partition.
RH 9 recognized my VIA82C sound card.  But I decided to switch to Alsa 
drivers.  I  downloaded last release (9.5).
After installing alsa drivers there was a noise after a sound was 
played.  On the sound server setup I selected:
Use custom sampling rate: 48000
and:
Other custom options:
-a oss


After compiling the drivers, be sure to run snddevices.  If you miss it, 
then amixer and alsamixer will not run.
Then, I compiled and installed the alsa-libs and then alsa-utils.

I run alsamixer several times to change PCM and Master controls to 
different levels to test aplay /usr/share/sound/startup3.wav.  Aplay 
played sounds at volumn levels controlled by alsamixer.

So, I think you missed to run snddevices under the alsa-drivers directory.

I hope this will help you.
The same Alsa drivers are running very well on my RHat 8.0 partition.

Frank,
   Actually, your results are extremely helpful. Now I know this is a
bug which is a step forward. Thanks.

   My hardware (HDSP 9652) is currently unsupported, but we are trying
to get it to work. I just needed verification that the command worked
the way you say. I suspected it did.


  May I ask what hardware you are using, and if you attempted to use (or
could you try out?) both mono and stereo wave files? I am curious
whether for you a mono wave file would be played on all channels, as my
driver is currently doing, or just channel 1, and whether a stereo file
is played as mono or in stereo.

   Anyway, your response was exactly what I was hoping for. Thanks much
for verifying this.

Cheers,
Mark





-->><<--__-->><<--

Depends on the hardware (or the driver). Many cards have a mixer for
certain output streams and/or a master mixer, some don't. (ALSA
doesn't modify volume levels in software by default).


The plughw plugin automatically converts sample formats. To access the
hardware directly, use "hw:0" instead of "plughw:0", but this won't
work if your file isn't exactly in a format supported by the hardware.

To access a subset of the channels, you can use the route plugin IIRC.
The "documentation" at
<http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/alsa-lib/pcm_plugins.html> lacks
the interesting parts, so try to search in the list archives.

hello,

csound used to be fairly easy to compile, but that was long time ago. it'=
s
true that compiling canonical csound has been problematic lately. my
experience in the last 2 years has been:

1) for some time i used istvan varga's sources. i do have Xwindows
installed but i didn't have fltk at that time. there was no configure or
anything, so i just had to edit the Makefile by hand commenting out all
references to fltk. i'm not a programmer, i guess my solution was rather
crude, but it worked. once, after a fresh build of linux from scratch, i
tried to compile csound before installing X and i had to do similar
trimmings in the Makefile. it worked, it was then that i realized that
csound depends on X more than i could have suspected.

2) now i'm using canonical again. (after a long interchange of harsh
emails between istvan and the "official" developers, he definitely
disappeared from the scene, and his sources and binaries with him). i eve=
n
installed fltk to be able to see these knobs and sliders everyone's
hollering about. but ffitch's makefile didn't work for me, only when
steven yi posted a modified makefile to the csound list (20030704) i was
successful. the binaries also work, but with my binaries i get about
10-15% faster performance.=20

i'm talking about csound 4.23f04 at sourceforge.

good luck,

 I'm not disputing that at all.


 I don't actually program... I muck about with scripts. It's the same as emacs...
 with the same potential. I've not actually messed with snd that much... I'm still
 making an effort at other stuff {web pages - http://www.cs.auc.dk/~normark//laml/ ,
 a consistent set of applications - http://gemacs.sourceforge.net/ 
 http://www.sgi.com/software/inventor/ , http://glame.sourceforge.net/index.var ,
 opendx, vtk, common music, etc, etc... which I'd eventually like to try to tie
 together with this sort of interface. http://www.rocklyte.com/athene/index.html 
 {needless to say... the overall learning curve is a little steep.}} like learning to
 use scheme to the point that it will actually do something useful.
 
 The default in debian is pretty complete and fairly enabled. As far as maintianance... 
 it's one of few applications that require none on the systems I've set up.


 I've used emacs for years... the interface seems pretty natural to me. I've not
 noticed that there is a learning curve.


 I use soundforge in win.... I like snds interface better. It seems more like a
 drawing to me {if that makes any sense} 
 http://ccrma-www.stanford.edu/software/snd/snd/snd.html ...It seems more
  "graphical". but like you're actually manipulating the drawing rather than
 buttons and knobs.

 
 Alright...

 Emacs seems like the ideal interface to me for composing sequences of 
 symbolic links... If you wanted to tie perl into it you could possibly
 do this:

 http://john-edwin-tobey.org/perlmacs/src/
    
 "a 
     a
        a
           a
              aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa"

 {Assuming you're familiar with the interface in fruit loops
 Emacs has pretty nifty graphical features already. You could
 simulate the fruit loops interface with ansi blocks... even use bitmaps.}


 Nyquist is pretty nifty as well...




-->><<--__-->><<--

Mark,

I absolutely cannot force a play out one channel.  Again, using -c 1 
which the manpage suggests is channel #, or  to quote: "number of 
channels."  I played both a mono .wav and an .au file and they came out 
of both channels.  Stereo plays out both channels with the 
psychoacoustic image of spatiality.

Hardware here is an onboard cs4236 chip (also MidiMan 2x2 outboard USB) 
with the latest CCRMA updates to RedHat 8.0 SMB workstation running 
FluxBox (we've talked before), and everything seems to work as expected.

So, what's going on here?  Is this a default behavior with mono files? 
Is this a bug?  Why can't a signal be forced to one channel?

Frank




-->><<--__-->><<--


Frank,
   This is interesting data. Thanks for checking things out. And I most
certainly remember talking before, but I did not remember anything about
your specific hardware! ;)

   I read the man page for the -c option a bit differently. I thought it
was saying how many channels I wanted the file to be played or recorded
on, and not what channel number I wanted the file played on. To me this
would make more sense for the arecord command, where you could tell it
to record 1 channel only, but again the problem is 'which channel'?


Seems to be one or the other. Even under Windows Media Player a mono
file plays from both speakers, so Alsa doing the same thing is not a
real suprise I suppose, but I agree that I should at least have an
option to play it in mono, and also, since we are all using hardware
capable of more than stereo, I'd certainly like an option to choose what
channel/channels aplay sends audio to.

Where does one send enhancement requests for aplay/arecord?

Thanks much for your help! I see Clemens has also responded today with
some interesting info.

Mark





-->><<--__-->><<--
Clemens,
   Thanks very much for responding. A couple of questions below.
Cheers,
Mark



OK, so the RME HDSP 9652 has a mixer as I use it under Windows. In this
case, I would assume that alsamixer would not show mixer controls if the
driver didn't tell it the hardware had a mixer? 

To clarify, what I'm understanding is that since Alsa doesn't modify
volumes in software, then the hardware has to do it, and the alsamixer
controls (or amixer controls) show the levels that Alsa is telling the
hardware to modify volumes by?

Makes sense, I think...



Very helpful. plughw would address having the card in a certain
frequency mode, but playing a file recorded at a different frequency.
This is great from a user's POV. Thanks.

I suppose hw:0 would be sensible if I recorded from the card, saved in
the card's data format, and then wanted to play that back. Sounds
efficient.


Will do. Maybe this route plugin will help me test which channels are
and are not working with this new driver.

Thanks!

Cheers,
Mark




-->><<--__-->><<--

I may use emacs, but I don't consider myself an "emacs user".  I do all my 
perl coding in emacs, but stopped having time to mess with elisp about 10 
years ago.  The only reason I keep using emacs is that ^p, ^n, ^f and ^b et 
al are burned into my finger muscles by now.  Heretical though it may be, I 
consider it to be just an editor, easily replacable by the likes of jove, mg 
and jed in a pinch, though I'm enough used to typing things like M-x 
comment-region that I haven't switched to jed fulltime.  

I don't like lisp or its siblings or descendents very much (though I thought 
the implementation in sawfish was useful), and that's what's kept me from 
picking up Nyquist as well though I expect to use it to customize Audacity in 
the future.  I'll likely come up with some way to generate midi or (better 
yet) csound files out of perl code one of these days.  Maybe I could even 
generate Nyquist source files so that I could have the benefits of that 
language without all that Lisp.

But I'm a programmer by trade, so it shouldn't be surprising that I am a 
little more open to that kind of thing than normal musicians.  There would be 
no way in hell I could promote such a solution to my friends and colleagues 
who own or work at studios or are themselves musicians: people, in other 
words, who aren't "computer musicians", but who are using computers to record 
their non-electronic music because it's easier/cleaner/cheaper than tape.  
Audacity, on the other hand, for quickie jobs (and maybe eventually Ardour 
for the main job) may be something they could look at and say "Yeah, I could 
do my work in that."

csound is currently in a code freeze and is currently being redesigned
with a more modular architecture.  the idea of using autoconf/etc. for
building is also being thrown around, and will hopefully be included
soon. my feeling is that having the source finally gpl'd and up on
sourceforge is going to be great for the language, although development
has been a little bit slow for my tastes. ;)

i think the lack of updates on csounds.com has more to do with the fact
that it's largely maintained by one person, dr. richard boulanger;=20
while it's a pretty comprehensive resource it obviously hasn't kept pace
with developments in the user/dev community, for whatever reason.=20

 The link is to perlmacs. "Perl"

 The gobbledegook I typed before was an idea as to how to set up a file that you
 parse with some engine or another and possibly run within emacs. The reference to
 symlinks is an idea as how to manage sample banks... It all strikes me as an easy
 way to generate music from emacs or anything that would run your wave player for
 you.

 I like computer music.

I never dreamed that this question would spark such a response, even if 
it did get a little off topic at times ;),  I thank you all.

So, overall it sounds to me like the "serious" way of doing it is still 
micing the amps. True?

I am not only concerned with blowing the doors off the neighbor's house 
(they are hardly home anyway ;) ), but ambient noise.  I live pretty 
close to a major road, and I get bumpers* driving through the 
neighborhood which could really screw up a track  (very frustrating).

So ardour and audacity would have plugins that would help me emulate a 
mic'd sound?

I am putting together a wishlist for a new system.. pretty soon I will 
be able to put it up to review :0).

Thanks again for all your help.

I have not yet tried it. My project this past weekend was figuring out
the ecasound chain settup for a project I've had in mind for years...
It's exciting to have finally made some progress on it. :)

Hopefully this coming weekend, or possibly wednesday of this week, I'll
try the remote 25. I'm not exactly sure how to proceed. I haven't used
any usb devices before, so I don't know what I need to do to test it.
Is there a FAQ, howto or quicktoot on setting up a USB MIDI device? If
not I'll write up something basic if I can get this working.

I know I'll need to recompile the kernel with usb support, but looking
at it briefly in make menuconfig there appear to be a lot of options.
These seem the most pertinent:
CONFIG_USB (obviously)
CONFIG_USB_UHCI_ALT (turned on by default when CONFIG_USB is selected)
CONFIG_USB_AUDIO ??? is this needed for a midi device, or is that only
                     for USB audio interfaces?

Anything else? there are some verbose debugging options or something
like that. Are those helpful?

Presumably some userspace packages need to be installed (i'm on debian
testing at home): hotplug, usbmgr, libusb

Then there are the alsa modules: usb-audio, serialmidi(probably this
isn't needed?)

I'll need to install an application for it to talk to as well. I'll
probably try it with ams or ssm. 

Anyway, to answer your question, I haven't had time to try it, yet. But,
I will soon. I'll let you know what I find out.

Please forgive me for this brain dump, but I just had to share my
experiences...

As recently as 7 months ago, I'd never used Linux.  I had some
exeperience with Unix, but my primary system for work, home, audio,
etc. was Windows 2k.  On a whim, I decided to install Linux on a
secondary box at work and give it a try.  Within a month I had
installed Linux on all my computers and relegated Windoze to my
secondary box.  I still have to use it about once a week to do time
reporting in a web browser that uses ActiveX controls :-(

Anyway, it wasn't long after getting into Linux that I discovered
that an audio revolution is on the verge of taking place.  So I've
spent the last six months or so learning, building, rebuilding, and
trying to get it to work.  I started with Planet CCRMA, and it didn't
work.  Looking back on it, I think I did some things wrong.  Besides,
I really would like to be able to compile everything, so I can
analyze the code, and maybe contribute something.  It all started
coming together this weekend when I finally got Ardour to compile,
install, and even run !!

I wasn't trying to build a DAW just yet.  I just wanted to get it to
build and run on my laptop to experiment with it before I dive in. 
In a month or so I hope to be building a completely Linux-based DAW
and this was just a sort of "proof of concept".  My laptop is an IBM
Thinkpad T20, PIII 700 with 256MB RAM and 10GB HDD.  I installed
RedHat9 and went from there.  At some point I may install a USB or
PCMCIA soundcard to use it for spectral analysis and other things in
live use, but for now it's just a test box.

I followed Jan Depner's Installing from scratch howto at djcj.org
(thanks, Jan!!) and combined that with several other howto's googles,
and other info.  I built the low-latency kernel (3 or 4 times before
I finally got it right) with the low-latency and pre-emption patches,
installed ALSA, LADSPA, JACK, and much of the other stuff from Jan's
tutorial.  Then came Ardour.

I downloaded the tarball from the Ardour site.  It configured and
compiled without problems.  The interesting thing is that the first
time I started Ardour, my computer completely locked up.  The mouse
wouldn't move, I couldn't switch apps using the keyboard.  I figure
that if I had it connected to a network I could've SSH'd in and
killed some processes, but it wasn't connected, so I shut it down. 
Upon rebooting I had to run fsck to recover my filesystem.  Not an
extremely painful experience.  After I got everything booted back up,
I said "what the heck, I'll try it again", and this time it did not
crash.  I was able to import some wave files and play around with it.
 I was not able to record using my laptop's mic, but I haven't really
tried to debug that yet, and it's not terribly important at this
point.

I wanted to do some more experimenting, so I downloaded and installed
wxWindows-GTK and Freqtweak, compiled, and installed them.  For some
reason Freqtweak gives me an error when I try to run it.  Something
about cannot load wxGTK-2.4.1.so, no such file or directory.  I
suppose I need to learn something about installing shared libraries
and making them available to other applications.  Any tips would be
appreciated.

Well, I said all that to say a huge THANK YOU!! to all who have
contributed these tools.  I can't wait to really get started.  It's
always been my dream to develop and use audio software and now it
looks like there's a platform for doing that.  So, I plan to continue
down this path, and hopefully, be able to contribute something.  It
looks like a lot of these tools could use some good documentation, so
maybe I'll look into that.

If you've read this far, thank you again.
Greg

Be sure you are not using ext3 with certain versions of the 2.4.20
kernel.  Jan's page should have covered this I think, so this
might not have been the issue.

Hmm.  When you installed wxGTK from source, it probably went into
/usr/local/lib (unless you specified --prefix=/usr on the configure
line).  You need to make sure that this is in your library path.
The easiest way is to edit your /etc/ld.so.conf file and add a
line with '/usr/local/lib'.  Then run 'ldconfig'.

Hope this helps....

Hi all,

I'm having a problem trying to use esd with alsa and an ens1371 card.

setup on boxes A and B:
alsa-driver-0.9.5_r2
alsa-lib-0.9.4
esound-0.2.29
linux-2.4.21-rc4-aa1

On box A, I'm using a cmipci driver, box B, an ens1371.
modules.conf has identical (except for driver id) content on both boxen.
Everything alsa works on both boxen, playback and capture.
Esound playback works on both boxen.

The Problem:

Esound esdrec works on box A, but not box B.

On box B, esdrec times out and exits (yes, esd is running). It appears as
though it looks to a port for capture data, sees none, then bails. Esound
documentation is famously anemic, googling got me this far...

Weird bit to me is that non-esound alsa capture is working fine on box B,
it's just that esdrec doesn't seem to be addressing the right port.

Anyone have any ideas?

Like how does esdrec know which port to see, or how do I tell it to look
in the "right place" for a capture stream...or how to set the "default
port" so esdrec "just finds it" like on box A...

Many thanks!!

I built a Gentoo audio system a little over a month ago. I kept a weblog
of the whole thing.

http://www.fallingforward.net/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=62

Regarding the gentoo-mm sources, I could not run that kernel with my
hardware. It would compile but kernel panic when I rebooted. Strangely
enough, I had to take the kernel config from a Mandrake installation, and
plug it into a stock kernel from kernel.org to get not only low-latency
but also DMA to work.

My gentoo system is alright now, but Rosegarden won't build, due to some
obscure little dependancy conflicts documented here:
http://www.all-day-breakfast.com/rosegarden/faq.html#toc13

And the most super obscure problem that just happened is Rosegarden CVS
won't autoconf because it thinks gentoo's autoconf version is 2.13 when
the package manager says it's 2.57-r1!

Hello,

I tried to connect MAudio USB audio interface Sonica on my Compaq Laptop with 
vector Linux.  the light on Sonica is tunred ON meaning that it used 
electricty from USB port, but I cannot hear any sound.  DO you know how to 
set up Sonica to work under Linux?

Thanks,

Vedran Vucic

You need a firmware loader, which doesn't currently exist.

Maybe you should ask M Audio if they plan to cooperate with the 
community on Linux support for this particular device. Doesn't hurt 
to ask...

Cheers

I will ask.

All the best,

-->><<--__-->><<--

This isn't needed in this case, the downloading protocol is already
known (it's DFU). The only problem is that somebody actually has to
write the loader.

-->><<--__-->><<--
Dear colleagues,

As far as I see Sonica does have two important chips only.  AKM AK4353VF and 
Texas Instruments TAS 1020A.  Maybe this can help in creating firmware 
downloader for Sonica.
Maybe TI can offer specification.

All the best,

Vedran Vucic 





-->><<--__-->><<--
I think that such loader should not be much different than it is for USB DUO 
or USB quatro which are already working in LINUXOS>

Vedran Vucic





-->><<--__-->><<--

Do you mean that the firmware is already available, but currently 
there's no way of getting it into the device under Linux?

I still think approaching M Audio is worth a try. If they know people 
are actually buying their hardware to use specifically on Linux-based 
systems then they might be inclined to work on a Linux/ALSA-friendly 
firmware loader themselves, rather than just release specs for 
someone else to write it.

I bought a Delta 1010 just because of the (third-party) Linux support 
for the device, so there's a few dollars they can put into a firmware 
loader straight away...  
 
Cheers

Daniel



-->><<--__-->><<--
Yes, I contacted them and I will see what is their reply.  However, I will 
let you know.

All the best,

Vedran Vucic








-->><<--__-->><<--

And the last time Clemens and I tried this, I had to RMA my Sonica. The DFU loader seemed to have eaten the base firmware on the unit. The Sonica was detected as a "unprogrammed" USB device (it's device IDs changed). Needless to say, the M-Audio tech support was really baffled and tried to get me to re-install the Sonica drivers a few dozen times. :P

later,
Steve





-->><<--__-->><<--

You can grab the firmware from the Windows driver. In the 1220 driver package, it's called 'ma005101.bin'. Run the installer, and you'll find the firmware in your %TEMP% folder.

later,
Steve



-->><<--__-->><<--
Dear Steve,

Please try to be more specific. If I understood you properly I should install 
driver for Sonica in Windows and have firmware in TEMP directory.  What 
should I do with it in order to get Sonica work in Linux.?


Thanks,

Vedran







-->><<--__-->><<--

I asked them and we will see what they will say.

Okay Patrick... more headaches for you maybe?

I finally bought a Quattro.  All seems fine except I can't read/write to it.  
I assume it has something to do with this 'initialization' problem Takashi has 
mentioned, but I'm not sure.  I'm really hoping to get this working soon so I 
can include it in the next Mandrake Audio HowTo blah blah.

I used Patrick's .asoundrc, and the module loads fine.  Everything that one 
expects shows up in /proc/asound.

[root@gamma373-165 austin]# ls /proc/asound
card0/  cards  devices  modules  oss/  pcm  Quattro@  seq/  timers  version

But I can't seem to use it:
[root@gamma373-165 austin]# alsaplayer
ALSA lib pcm_hw.c:1055:(snd_pcm_hw_open) open /dev/snd/pcmC0D0p failed: No 
such device
snd_pcm_open: No such device (default)

qinit seems to segfault:
[root@gamma373-165 austin]# ./qinit
Initialising quattro
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

Then nothing works:
[root@gamma373-165 austin]# alsaplayer -d Quattro
ALSA lib pcm.c:1908:(snd_pcm_open_noupdate) Unknown PCM Quattro
snd_pcm_open: No such file or directory (Quattro)

ALSA lib pcm_hw.c:1055:(snd_pcm_hw_open) open /dev/snd/pcmC0D0p failed: No

ALSA lib pcm.c:1908:(snd_pcm_open_noupdate) Unknown PCM Quattro
aplay: main:484: audio open error: No such file or directory

BTW, this is Mandrake Cooker (gcc 3.3.1, alsa 0.9.6, glibc 2.3.2, linux 
2.4.21.6mdk).  Any help at all is appreciated.

Thanks,

The Sonica wont work right now. The firmware loader doesn't exist, but the firmware is available if one ever did. I killed my Sonica with an experimental DFU loader, so take care if you're playing with this stuff. I don't think M-Audio will give out their base firmware loader to 'recover' a busted unit. It cost me shipping and a whole bunch of time and money for long distance phone calls to tech support to get mine back in order. Wee!

Austin,
   I use different hardware, but have seem problems like this when using the
wrong interface into Alsa. My drivers doesn't support everything yet. Maybe
you can try

aplay -Dplughw:0

(or some other form of that) and see what happens?

I get the same error.
I'm thinking maybe only the midi driver is running, and not the pcm driver?

/proc/asound/card0 only contains 'id' and 'midi0'.  Should it also contain 
'pcm0' or similar?

Hallo,


Is there actually a device /dev/snd/pcmC0D0p on your /dev-"partition"?
/dev/snd used to be a link to /proc/asound/dev but that directory
isn't in ALSA anymore, so /dev/snd has to be a "real" device
directory, created for example with the snddevices script. (I cannot
speak for devfs, I'm not using it)

Yeah you're right... only the midi interface is registering.  I'm using 
devfsd, but it's easy to tell what's happening.

--unplug Quattro--
[root@gamma373-165 usb]# ls /dev/snd
controlC0  controlC2  controlC4  controlC6  seq
controlC1  controlC3  controlC5  controlC7  timer

--plug in Quattro--
[root@gamma373-165 usb]# ls /dev/snd
controlC0  controlC2  controlC4  controlC6  midiC0D0  timer
controlC1  controlC3  controlC5  controlC7  seq

Maybe a problem with /etc/modules.conf?
# --- ALSA configuration

# --- OSS compatibility
alias sound-slot-0 snd-card-0
alias sound-service-0-0 snd-mixer-oss

/var/log/daemons/errors shows modprobe complaining about to snd-card-1 through 
snd-card-9, but all else works fine.

Maybe a question for the alsa-devel list?

Hallo,


I don't think the modules conf. has anything to do with it. I just
found this on alsa-project.org: 

  2003-05-19  	*** 0.9.3b driver maintaince release *** ISA PnP and
  other fixes. We removed /proc/asound/dev directory. The 'make
  install' should create new device files, but in case of problems,
  the snddevices script should be executed.


Might help.

It's not a /dev problem... There is no pcm stream in /proc/asound/Quattro... 
there is only midi0 there.

I have not been successful in getting this keyboard recognized on the
usb bus, let alone by the usb-audio driver. I'm going to see if I can
get it working via straight midi into my ymfpci-based guillemot
maxisound fortissimo. But, can anyone see anything else I can try? I've
tried to gather as much info as I could think of...maybe I'm just not
understanding something basic ... Please help.


My system is debian testing (sarge) with kernel 2.4.19 with preempt and
lowlatency patches and the following usb options turned on:

CONFIG_USB=m
CONFIG_USB_DEVICEFS=y
CONFIG_USB_UHCI_ALT=m
CONFIG_USB_AUDIO=m

lsusb returns nothing and there is nothing in /proc/bus/usb/devices (
which I
guess says the same thing. ) 

I compiled and installed alsa-0.9.6 drivers, libs, utils and
envy24control.
the drivers were configured like this:

./configure --with-cards=ice1712,usb-audio --with-sequencer=yes
--with-oss=no

I have the following in modules.conf:

 Have you got the hotplug stuff installed?

http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/doc-php/template.php3?company=Midiman&card=USB+Audio+Quattro&chip=Cypress+AN2131XX&module=usb-audio

 Check the other messages in here? ^

Yes, hotplug is installed.  It's part of Mandrake 9.1.

If you're referring to ez-usb hotplug, it shouldn't be required.  Although, 
no, I haven't tried it.  It's midi-specific anyway, which is, incidentally, 
the only thing that IS working.

Thanks,

Hi guys!

In the last days had some nice experience with terminatorX. I think it works
well, but I don't know if the scratching is working correct.

I started scratching and noticed, that the soundfile is played only forwards
whatever direction the mouse is moved. When I set the "mouse speed" to a
negative value soundfiles are always played backwards when scratching
(holding the left mousebutton or pressing the "space"-key).

Is it possible to play the soundfile in two directions?

For example:

mouse moving upwards while scratching -> playing forward
mouse moving downwards while scratching -> playing backward

Like a real turntable :)

Thanks for any suggestions!
Friendly regards,
Rainer (rainer.poisel-uhHnZVPQrac@public.gmane.org)

I had this problem recently when I got the new tX version.  Make sure that that xfree86-dga extention is being loaded.  You will most likely find that in /etc/X11/XF86Config.  Make sure you have:

In Section "Module":

SubSection  "extmod"

	and that the following line, if present, is commented:

#   Option    "omit xfree86-dga"   # don't initialise the DGA extension
EndSubSection


After this tX should scratch fine.

 Someplace back in that mess of messages I thought you said you were running Debian.
 

  It's USB specific... I don't know how it works with your card. I meant linux's hotplug
 stuff... It was just the first "easy to overlook" thing that I could think of that might give
 you those symptoms.

 Apparently you discover the actual problem a bit later in this discussion though.

 There were some problems with usb-uhci back in May. There's a kernel patch
 listed on Redhat and a few other sites about that time. Maybe you just need to
 upgrade?

I've just begun messing around with using these MIDI apps to interact 
with outboard devices (Yamaha keyboard, Boss drum machine, and Flextone 
guitar amp), but can't find a way to have a single track sequence 
contain multiple program change codes.  

Looking at program documentation and other MIDI information failed to 
turn up anything applicable, or called "insert program change" as I 
would expect.  Master Track edit in MusE is also a mystery.

Any advice on how to do this, or where to look for information?

Thanks!

Frank

In the list editor insert a Meta Event ....

C0  ProgNumber        for Midi Channel 1
C1  ProgNumber        for Midi Channel 2
.
.

Awesome, Josep.  I was at that dialog but didn't know what to enter. 
 Where did you find this information?

Also, do you know how to do this in Rosegarden?  There doesn't appear to 
be an insert option.

Thanks again!

Frank





-->><<--__-->><<--

I was about to describe how to do this in Rosegarden, but then I 
realised that (I think, anyway) the feature was actually added after 
the last stable release, so it's only in CVS (which is not particularly 
stable right now).  In versions up to and including the 0.9.1 release, 
the only way to get program changes within a track is to record them 
from a MIDI input.

For completeness sake: Rosegarden generally prefers to have one program 
per track, with the program for a track being that associated with the 
track in the instrument parameter box that can optionally be shown on 
the left of the main window.  In recent code you can insert program 
changes as well, but so far only in the event-list editor.  Open an 
event list and select Insert Event, specifying the type "programchange" 
with the channel and program you want.

Thanks a lot!

I commented the "omit xfree86-dga" line and after that it worked fine.

Friendly regards,

I thought I had installed hotplug, but apparently I forgot. After
installing it the uhci driver loads. However, still no midi. After
stopping alsa and then hotplug and then starting hotplug and alsa via
init scripts I see this in /var/log/messages:

turning the remote 25 off and back on yields this:

aconnect doesn't show anything either:

         snd-usb-audio

Is there any other info I could provide that might help? 

Steve mentioned that i might need the snd-usb-midi driver instead, but
if i remember correctly it was merged into the snd-usb-audio driver a
while back. Is that true?

Are there some options I'm supposed to pass to snd-usb-audio via
modules.conf?

I've read about special case quirks being added for specific usb
devices, but haven't understood what they are... Could that be possible
with the remote 25?

Thanks for your help,
Eric Rz.

Thanks, Chris.  I had come across a comment regarding this in 
Rosegarden, but couldn't (obviously, since I'm not running the CVS, but 
rather the 0.9.1 version) find any way to do it.  I agree with the 
convention of one instrument per track but wanted to actually control a 
guitar effects processor with patch changes all from one track.

Keep up the great work.  This program has a beautiful interface and is 
quite stable and functional.  

Sorry to have also sent you a message from the Contact link on 
SorceForge, but I've been scrambling around all day trying to figure 
this out.  By the way, that Meta Events answer Josep shared with MusE 
has not yet worked, so I contacted Werner for help.  Absolutely nothing 
came up in a search of MusE + "event editor" or MusE + "meta event" (as 
was also the case with my Rosegarden search) so I had to wimp out and 
beg once again.

Thanks for your time!

Hello all,

	I have a session comeing up this weekend where I'll need three
set of headphones monitoring the mix.  This is a problem, since I have a
Delta44, and am limited to four channels of output.  I also have an
SBLive I use for MIDI, and I'm trying to make a virtual device to take
advantage of that output as well.

	I started with the asoundrc in the wiki for this in the wiki, at
http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=TwoCardsAsOne but if I try to
aplay to it:

ross@turalyon:~$ aplay -D multi synth.wav
Playing WAVE 'synth.wav' : Signed 16 bit Little Endian, Rate 44100 Hz, Stereo
aplay: set_params:783: Broken configuration for this PCM: no configurations available

I pretty much snipped the config directly, and added lines for my
additional channels.  I also tried making a copy device, but this plays
for a second (out of the Live) and then quits with an I/O error:

ross@turalyon:~$ aplay -D copy synth.wav
Playing WAVE 'synth.wav' : Signed 16 bit Little Endian, Rate 44100 Hz, Stereo
aplay: pcm_write:1025: write error: Input/output error

Here's my ~/.asoundrc:

pcm.multi {
        type multi;
        slaves.a.pcm "hw:0,0";
        slaves.a.channels 4;
        slaves.b.pcm "hw:1,0";
        slaves.b.channels 2;
        bindings.0.slave a;
        bindings.0.channel 0;
        bindings.1.slave a;
        bindings.1.channel 1;
        bindings.2.slave a;
        bindings.2.channel 2;
        bindings.3.slave a;
        bindings.3.channel 3;
	bindings.4.slave b;
	bindings.4.channel 0;
	bindings.5.slave b;
	bindings.5.channel 1;
}

ctl.multi {
        type hw;
        card 0;
}

pcm.ttable {
        type route;
        slave.pcm "multi";
        ttable.0.0 1;
        ttable.1.1 1;
        ttable.2.2 1;
        ttable.3.3 1;
	ttable.4.4 1;
	ttable.5.5 1;
}
ctl.ttable {
        type hw;
        card 0;
}

pcm.copy {
	type copy;
	slave.pcm "hw:0,0"
	slave.pcm "hw:1,0"
}

Thanks for any tips!

Class ff is "vendor-specific", so it's not 100% compatible with the
USB Audio Specification.


Yes, it's true (that the former is not true).


Those are for devices that are almost compatible with the spec. This
may or may not be the case with the Remote25.

Please post the output of "lsusb -v".

Clemens

I have problem too with alsa and ens1371.
It seems caused by buggy alsa driver,
just change the kernel or recompile newest alsa driver.

| Hi all,
|
| I'm having a problem trying to use esd with alsa and an ens1371 card.
|
| setup on boxes A and B:
| alsa-driver-0.9.5_r2
| alsa-lib-0.9.4
| esound-0.2.29
| linux-2.4.21-rc4-aa1
|
| On box A, I'm using a cmipci driver, box B, an ens1371.
| modules.conf has identical (except for driver id) content on both boxen.
| Everything alsa works on both boxen, playback and capture.
| Esound playback works on both boxen.
|
| The Problem:
|
| Esound esdrec works on box A, but not box B.
|
| On box B, esdrec times out and exits (yes, esd is running). It appears as
| though it looks to a port for capture data, sees none, then bails. Esound
| documentation is famously anemic, googling got me this far...
|
| Weird bit to me is that non-esound alsa capture is working fine on box B,
| it's just that esdrec doesn't seem to be addressing the right port.
|
| Anyone have any ideas?
|
| Like how does esdrec know which port to see, or how do I tell it to look
| in the "right place" for a capture stream...or how to set the "default
| port" so esdrec "just finds it" like on box A...

Hi,

For a while now I've wanted to fiddle with a reasonably powerful
synthesis engine but haven't found a suitable one yet. I've been dying
to give csound a good try but haven't succeeded in compiling it yet, and
I've tried cmix but have found it a bit too "low-level" for my humble
tastes. My problem is that most of the interesting synthesis engines and
synth emulators today seem to come with a GUI and I can't use one, nor
do I care to, to be frank. So, does anyone have a suggestion for a
fairly powerful CLI synth engine I might try?

Thanks,
S.M.

some to consider:
SAOL & sfront?
CM & CLM?

Check out MSG, a synthesis/sampling engine:
http://stub.org/ex/MSG/MSG-1.09-PRELIM.tgz

It's used by slub - a noisy generative gabba pop band (http://slub.org/) they
use it to play live, triggered with perl scripts mainly I believe.
it's a pretty interesting bit of software anyway.

Hi

I'm trying to figure out if all the hardware in my new laptop is
supported. For this purpose I'm trying out knoppix for the first time,
but sound is not working. sndconfig finds the card as "Intel
Corporation|82440MX AC97 Audio Controller" but only a small click is
heard when trying to play a sample. "play somesample.wav" returns
"playing somesample.wav" and the aforementioned click is heard.

Does anyone know knoppix well enough to help me, since I'd rather not
install anything in case I have to give it back (if the hardware is not
supported)?

Thanks in advance...

 Seems like the best answer of the bunch to me, anyway.

 If that's what you want to use... there's got to be 30 different implementations
 {not to mention versions} of it available. One of them's got to compile... 
 
...Somebody's got to have a binary...

Hi All,

I am just switching to Linux and am trying to find something that can make my 
Casio CTK-671 keyboard work. It has no buit-in rhythm programming but rhythms 
can be downloaded into it through MIDI interface. These are available for 
download from Casio music web site

http://music.casio.com/e/671/

But there is no software that allows you to compose the ones of your own. Not 
to mention that there is no Linux version of the software.

There is a 60-page MIDI manual however

http://ftp.casio.co.jp/pub/world_manual/emi/en/ctk_671/midi.pdf

and Windows version of the downloader:

http://music.casio.com/e/671/before.html

With these I hope I will be able to figure out how to program and download 
rhytms into the keyboard. I wonder however is there is a standard protocol? 
Do you know of anyone who ever tried to figure this out? It makes sense to 
learn what others have done so far before starting a new project.

I would appreciate your help and any information that you may have.

Kind regards,
Lex

I would recommend SuperCollider, and object oriented DSP/MIDI language
based on Smalltalk. It might be ported to Linux but I'm not sure. There is
also Nyquist, based on Lisp and very cross-platform. Csound is the
formadible beast. Then there's PD, which is not command line but very
powerful. And if you're into Java check out Jsyn or Jmax. The list goes on
and on and on and on....

that should be the latest canonical version.  another option is istvan
varga's build, which is unmaintained but fairly useable and stable. it's
fairly in sync with the most recent canonical, has various features and
bugfixes that didn't make their way into the last canonical release
(AFAIK), and has binaries that you can run out of the box.  you can find
his version at  http://www.csounds.com/istvan;  i'd recommend using
4.24.0 rather than 4.24.1, as the latter is buggier.

Greetings,

I remember some talk a while ago about different filesystems and their 
performance. All my partitions are formatted as reiserfs and I get 
terrible performance. I've done tons of tests, bought a 7200 RPM drive, 
bought more ram, worked with buffer sizes... So I'm assuming that I need 
to format my drive as another filesystem.

I also put the following entry in fstab:

none      /tmp        tmpfs     defaults      0 0

I understood this as putting /tmp in ram? I'm getting such poor 
performance that I actually move my sound files in /tmp and work out of 
it while doing multitracking.

Could anyone tell Me what the conclusion was about what is the best 
filesystem for these kinds of heavy recording loads?

Thanks,
Rocco

 I've used all of these with no problems.

http://aurora.zemris.fer.hr/filesystems/

 If it's a real problem... try setting up an ext2 partition and using it as a
 working drive. If it's still a problem... I'd look to something other than
 the filesystem. Maybe hdparm?




-->><<--__-->><<--


Rocco,
   I published some stuff which is on Jan Depner's site. You can find
that in Google.

   I used reiserfs on my audio partition with good success. If it's not
working well for you, then we should try and get to the bottom of why.
Do a few measurements.

Wizard root # hdparm -tT /dev/hda

/dev/hda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   768 MB in  2.00 seconds = 384.00 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  130 MB in  3.01 seconds =  43.19 MB/sec
Wizard root # 

The first speed is talking only to the drive's buffer RAM, so it's very
fast. The second is actually reading off the drive, so it's more
important.

   What sort of numbers do you get?

   Remember, rotational speed is only one of the aspects of how fast a
drive is.

Good luck,
Mark

Hi

Dayly talk :)

- On gmorgan anounces, you say "fast computer" . It can be interesting to say how much fast ( > C400 by example) it should be, because not everyone agrees about what a fast computer is.

- On freshmeat, the photo for gmorgan is the Batch Play Song editor. Maybe for new-comers, the main window looks more "musical" ?

- About the Batch Play Song editor, is it generated "on-the-fly" ? because I didn't found where to go to skin it.

You know what? Yesterday night it snowed on my tropical island! It's incredible! It is on the 3069 meter high mountain and on the volcano (nearly 2500 m) and we have there sometimes a little snow that fade away in two-three hours, but so much has never been seen here!

I got terrible performance from my 7200 RPM ATA 100 disks because DMA was
not getting enabled in the kernel. I couldn't figure out the problem
because I did enable it when I compiled my kernel. My silly hack was to
use the kernel config left over from my previous Mandrake installation,
where DMA was working fine, and move it to my new Gentoo installation when
I compiled my kernel. And now...

bash-2.05b# hdparm -t /dev/hda

ReiserFS is very fast filesystem, but there's alot more to it than just =

I got a little ambitious this weekend. Installed Wine, configured it
according to the docs on winehq.org and everything seems good. I can run
notepad.exe... :) wow, he says sarcasticaly.

Of course my big reason for even bothering with Wine is so I can install
my favoirte audio app for Windows, a tracker called Jeskola Buzz. Now mind
you, I don't have Windows installed on my Gentoo system, only Wine,
and the ebuild is the CVS version 20030618-r1.

I downloaded the base installer for Buzz and it installed! Now I run Buzz
and it tells me it can't find the waveOut device, and crashes  :(

Does anyone else have experience with using Wine and getting audio apps to
work? My Linux audio system uses ALSA.

Wine's configuration files allow you to choose the type of audio
interface you want to use. Try that out.

I used the Jack interface and did manage to get a bit of sound out of a
couple of Windows apps once, but it wsan't very successful for me. I
hope it goes better for you.

While Buzz does have tracker functionality, that's only one of a couple 
hundred modules available for it.  Essentially, Buzz tries to be an all in 
one Jack-like environment, where you can use VST or DirectX instruments, or 
native Buzz instruments (a few of which are trackers) and route them through 
an arbitrary number of Buzz, VST or DX effects prior to output to speaker or 
disk.  Trouble is, its author lost the source code years ago and updates come 
in the form of binary hacks of the executable and more and more module 
setups.

Jack is already more flexible and as it builds more critical mass, may 
ultimately be more powerful.  But the only things Buzz has in common with 
Soundtracker are the ability to play samples if you want to, and a 
tracker-like interface for entering notes.

Rob




-->><<--__-->><<--
Replying to the Wine thread reminded me of something I was thinking about last 
week and meant to ask the list.  I've seen a number of sample playback 
engines or programs that play .SF2 soundfonts, and for .PAT's of course 
there's Timidity++.  Is there any way to run T++ as a Jack application, or 
run some other application that incorporates T++ somehow to use my vast 
collection of .PAT files from my GUSPnP days as soundfonts?

If not, is there any way under Linux to convert my .PAT's to .SF2's?  I 
suppose I could buy Awave and try to get it working under Wine, but since 
there shouldn't be any actual data conversion going on I'd think someone 
might have written such a converter app years ago.

Maybe an ALSA-aware app would be good enough, since I'm running ALSA on my 
laptop now - I haven't actually tried to assemble a sequencer/synth suite 
under Linux yet because I haven't had any idea what to do with all my PAT 
files except render static .mid files to .wav using Timidity.

I got buzz working too, surprisngly also this weekend. I don't get the waveOut message, but I sometimes got it in Windows. When you get the message, can you still open the preferences menu in Buzz? If so, try to change the wave output driver to Windows Waveform Audio and if that doesn't work to one of the other possibilities. It works in alsa mode and oss-emulation mode. Oss-emulation seems to give less latency.

Thank you all for your many suggestions; I will try and have a look at
each as time permits. So far, sfront/SAOL seems most promising. I have

I'll give them another try just in case...

Hi,

3MU--- TB303 emulator--- seems like a neat bit of software, albeit

Hi guys,

I came a java based drum machine/step sequencer on freshmeat the other day 
called "Beats by Design".
To be truthful I didn't get it to do anything fancy, but my test was fairly 
short.
The description of it suggests it could be really cool though, it uses 
neural-nets in the engine (if I understand it correctly) to adapt and 
improvise.

I just wondered if anyone tried it and got it to do anything useful?

Hello -

I'm writing an article on Linux as an OS for audio production.  I was
wondering if I could take a poll of what people think is the best and the
worst Linux audio software.  I'm looking for sequencers, audio editors,
software synthesizers and samplers.  Not really looking for CD burning
software or MP3 players.

Please reply directly to: soulsource-j9pdmedNgrk@public.gmane.org

http://web.hibo.no/~mva/musiclinks.php  there are literally, thousands of
people using trackers. It's like a step sequencer but it's top down and
uses hex numbers (0 - F) instead of decimal (0 - 9). There are many demo
songs that come with the base Buzz installation. You can learn from them.

you may want to try http://www.united-trackers.org/2000/ where there are many different tips and tutorials for tracking sw.  Most of it will apply to soundtracker.  The website is being actively maintained by active trackers so there are also new pieces every week.  Not all of them great musically but you can download .xm modules and see how they're done.  That's the best way to learn different tricks, imo.

Buzz is a different kind of a beast.  There's a yahoo mailing list called something like exoperimental-music-with-buzz where people discuss different things and upload their examples to the list's fileserver.  You can learn from that, too.

The Buzz-Buzz Yahoo group is a great resource for would-be Buzz users, as well 
as people who like tracker music in general.  However, it's like a point of 
pride to not use samples in your Buzz tune, using instead the various Buzz 
synthesis modules to generate your sounds, so the culture is a little 
different than the tracker world at large.

Someone was working on a Buzz clone for Linux called GNU Octa-something, can't 
remember it right now nor can I find it, but it stalled a year and a half ago 
and I haven't heard anything about it since.

What might be really cool would be a Wine/Jack applet that just wrapped Buzz 
modules ;)  I seem to remember a similar wrapper for VST effects but don't 
know what became of it.

I think this is a very useful endeaver.  I've recently started down
the path of Linux audio and wondered myself "What's out there and how
good is it?"  A resource like that would be great for people coming
in.

Just so you'll know what I'm used to, my background is Cakewalk/Sonar
on Win2k.  Now, for about two weeks I've had MusE, Rosegarden, and
Ardour installed on a laptop and have been playing with them.  I've
not messed with Ardour much yet because my soundcard capabilities are
limited.  I hope to have a Linux DAW running by the end of the month
and have a lot more information then.  For now, my reviews will just
be limited to subjective first impressions of two MIDI sequencing
tools.

I'm very reluctant to give any bad reviews because I've made no real
attempts to optimize MusE or Rosegarden.  I've certainly not
contacted the mailing lists to find out how to get things to work
better.  And I can't say I've had enough time to give them a fair
chance.  So anything I say here is **FIRST IMPRESSION** and not
complete testing.

MusE (0.6.1)
I originally had some trouble compiling MusE.  I won't go into it b/c
I figure it's mostly learning curve related.  At first MusE crashed
on me every few minutes, but in the last couple of days has become a
lot more stable.  I've not made any attempts to get to the source of
that.  The interface is certainly usable.  I like the fact that you
can record multiple tracks at a time (I haven't tried it yet, but at
least you can *arm* multiple tracks).  I also like the fact that you
can start synths from within the application and save their
properties so you don't have to reload them every time you start to
edit a song - though it hasn't worked flawlessly with fluidsynth. 
The mixer window is very useful.  I found the notation window hard to
use.  The pianoroll window is somewhat hard but I got use to it. 
Neither of those windows would play back notes as I edited them, as I
would've liked.  Also, I don't like the way everything opens in a
different window.  I'd prefer some sort of multiple document
interface or something.

Rosegarden (latest stable version as of 7/15 - forgot the number)
Rosegarden's interface was initially easier to use than MusE's.  I
don't know if the buttons are bigger or what, but I just had a little
easier time getting around.  I also really like the big transport
window.  MusE has one too, but Rosegarden's is a little easer to use.
 But, I don't like the fact that you have to start your synths
externally from the application.  And, I didn't like the fact that
you could only record one track at a time.  The main thing I disliked
about RG was the lack of a mixer window (maybe I just haven't found
it yet).  RG seems to have really great notation features, but I
haven't gotten to use them a lot yet.

Overall, the combination of these tools seems very useful.  I would
like to have an application with MusE's track arranger, mixer window,
ability to create instances of softsynths and multi-track
capabilities, and Rosegarden's pianoroll and notation editors (but
not in separate windows unless I wanted them to be).  I'd also like
to see an API for creating and interacting with softsynths -- maybe
an extension to Jack?, and plugin/softsynth automation (maybe it's
already there).

The question of "can I be productive" is a definite yes.  If I've
gotten this far in two weeks of hardocre hacking at it, I imagine in
a month or two I'll never look back.  And this environment comes with
something huge that is not available anywhere else -- the ability to
analyze, modify, and contribute back to the applications.  To me,
that's worth a lot.

In a couple of months I hope to have some much better reviews.  Now,
I have to figure out how to write shorter emails.

Looking for point to point telephony ideas ...

- each end has a half-duplex sound card, Linux/OSS and mic/speaker,
- maximum bandwidth is 28800 bps, outback Australia analog lines,
- Debian is preferred distribution, but we can cope with builds,

While I could spend a few weeks researching all the packages that 
mention "phone" or "H.323" or "SIP", I'd rather ask some experts who
have tried it already, so as to use my time wisely.

I have looked already at speakfreely, linphone, and speex.  speakfreely
appears to be reasonably complete, but not easy to use.  linphone had a
host of dependencies that I was unable to resolve.  speex as an encoder
and decoder works really well on voice recordings, but I've no idea yet
if it will help.

I have found the OpenH323 project, but the clients listed on their page
are all Windows.

Reply direct to me; I realise that the list is primarily focussed on 
higher quality sound than mere telephony.  ;-)

Gnomemeeting (http://www.gnomemeeting.org/) is a good linux H323 client,
I've used it briefly for video and it worked pretty well, and I know some
people here use it for audio only.
 

I prefer to put stuff like this on lists, so answers can be found in list

Personally, I find the Creative Commons licences flexible, but far too 
wordy. They are more like a contract, a EULA, or the GNU GPL than 
existing music licences. Almost no-one reads the GPL end to end - 
that's why so many people don't understand it.

Look at any CD package; the licences tend to be about one paragraph 
long, and could be edited down to just one word - DON'T. A really 
good free music licence would be just as succinct.

If you want to allow derivative versions, have a look at the bLiP 
licence. Second item down on:

I went to their website and it was infact available, very cool. Turns out it 
was a songbook though, not a record.

Quote from Linux Journal:

"  Copywright, Guthrie Style
When Woody Guthrie was singing hillbilly songs on a little Los Angeles radio  
station in the late 1930s, he used to mail out a small mimeographed songbook 
to listeners who wanted the words to his songs. On the bottom of one page 
appeared the following: ``This song is Copyrighted in U.S., under Seal of 
Copyright # 154085, for a period of 28 years, and anybody caught singin it 
without our permission, will be mighty good friends of ourn, cause we don't 
give a dern. Publish it. Write it. Sing it. Swing to it. Yodel it. We wrote 
it, that's all we wanted to do.''

Probably 0.9.1.


I personally (as a RG developer) like this aspect; it means that
you treat every synth in the same way and the program behaves
more or less identically whether you're using soft synths or
hardware synths.  For a long time I've been moaning to people
(and to the LAD list, on occasion) that I'd like to see a
standalone GUI app specifically for managing soft synths: to me
that would be better than doing so from within the sequencer.
In the absence of such a thing, Rosegarden probably will acquire
the ability to start and stop synths at some point.  I'm not
sure whether we'll ever go to the extent of running them in-
process like (I think) MusE does.

In principle LADCCA should take care of this kind of thing for
you (restoring soft-synth connection state etc), but Rosegarden
doesn't support it (or vice versa) yet.


No, there isn't one.  Something of the sort is planned for 1.0
but it's not there yet.


Chris




-->><<--__-->><<--

Yeah, after I sent that email I thought about the fact that MusE
probably starts the synths in-process and I can see drawbacks to that
approach in certain situations.  I do like the fact that RG handles
evrerything as generic MIDI.  The thing I don't like about it is that
it forces me to do extra work outside of Rosegarden to get things
going.

Jack 0.75.0 has been released.

Changes:
Fixed pipe issues on Redhat systems (and others, perhaps)

I'd also like to point out a new program qjackctl
(http://qjackctl.sourceforge.net).

It's a qt interface for controlling jack and it looks very promising.

Something I keep pushing against is the myth that "stuff that is copyright

allegedly from the RIAA.  It is a gross simplification.

The more correct form is "stuff that is copyright can't be copied unless 
the copyright owner says you can."

The essense of the GPL is that copyright is retained, and permission is 
granted.  That Pete Seeger license is a very early form of the GPL.  ;-)

It probably helped that Seeger was working in a folk tradition where 
adapting other people's songs was the norm. I don't know if he'd have 
felt so happy about bootleg copies of his vinyl releases...

I guess for folk music, the song book is the source code and the 
performance is the binary.

But it seems that the ALSA modules in unstable are for kernel 2.4.20, which is not

kernel 2.4.20 running on 2.4.21? If not, is the only solution to install ALSA from

Hello friends,
I would like to ask you is there an application where i could use 
vumeters while I'm making a recording.
I actually use a mandrake 9.1 with : audacity, rezound, wavesurfer, 
GnuSound and others but none of them have vumeters for recordings.
Do you know if something is preview for that? or if someone works on app 
which do it?

thanks for your help

If you have a soundcard with a supported chipset, then the 
envy24control utility has good meters. The M Audio Delta series and 
the ST Audio cards, for instance.

Cheers

Daniel



-->><<--__-->><<--
If you install JACK then you could use meterbridge:
http://plugin.org.uk/meterbridge/ but you almost certainly dont want
actual VU meters, they are really only useful for analogue tape recodings
and broadcast.

I dont know which WAV editors support JACK.

- Steve




-->><<--__-->><<--

There are a few ways to so it.

Qarecord from the qalsatools has it, as well as ecawave and maybe snd 
too. You can also use meterbridge or ardour if you are recording through 
a jack setup.

I tried using qarecord for a large session (90 minutes) and it failed to 
record more than 2 minutes. When I stopped it spent about 20 minutes 
counting down all the bytes it had captured (supposedly). I assume it 
records to RAM. IIf this didn't happen I would use it all the time to 
record jams.

Matthias. Can you fill us in on why that would happen?

ecasignalview /dev/dsp foo.wav 

... ecasignalview is part of the ecasound package (www.eca.cx/ecasound).
Alternatively, if you want to GUI app, ecamegapedal provides you with 
vumeters (www.eca.cx/ecamegapedal). You use it just like ecasignalview:

ecamegapedal /dev/dsp foo.wav

In addition to providing vu-meters, both apps provide very reliable 
disk and audio i/o functionality for recording. Both apps also work with 
ALSA (replace /dev/dsp with 'alsa,default), JACK (replace with 
'jack_alsa') and aRts (replace with 'arts').

Maybe your soundcard doesn't have the envy24 chipset then.


The Audacity developers do talk about it quite a lot, but the program 
is a general purpose audio tool and not everyone records from live 
sources. Cross-platform, quite a few mixer utilities have level 
meters, so they aren't always needed within the recording application 
itself.

What operating system/libraries/etc. do you use? 

We use Linux. Debian or Knoppix to be specific. Most of the code is 
written in Python, except for the low-level tracking code, which is 
in C and C++. We use the Pysco optimizer to speed up the Python. We 
use OpenGL for graphics, and talk to the synthesizer using MIDI.

Hello,

I was wondering if there exists something like a linux software based
real-time guitar signal processor. Something like line6's pod, but not
that big, just to put some effects (distortion, wah wah, ...) on my
sound during playing (i.e. real time).

Completely new to this stuff, so I have completely no idea whether it
exists or even is feasible (latency etc...)

thanks,

Wouter




-->><<--__-->><<--

It's feasible and people have made their own but you won't find anything 
that small that claims to use Linux software for sale (yet).

If you want to make something you could get a midi controller footpedal 
and hook it up to ssm, ams, ecasound, pd, maybe even jackrack.

It would be fun but you would have to lug a notebook with midi or a 
portable PC around with you. If you want to find out about portable PCs 
check out my site

http://www.boosthardware.com

or there are a couple of other people doing similar who might chime in here.

You will need a good sound card too. Probably not a usb one though as 
they don't do low latency very well yet.

the initial idea, even adding some features not included in the initial 
project.


News in 0.10
-------------------

Skin engine with some examples.
New Patterns. (First time i spend some time to do it .. and are not to bad). 
Changes in initial look, help window, settings ...
Minor bugs solved.


In this momment this version is only availabel in :

Running alsaconf version 0.9.0 under Red Hat 9.0 with the Planet CCRMA
kernel and ALSA setup...

In running alsaconf to try to configure ALSA for my system's sound card
(reported as an "ens1371  Ensoniq 5880 AudioPCI (rev 03)"), I get the
following errors:

/usr/sbin/alsaconf: line 340: let: a=(>>2) & 0x3f: syntax error: operand
expected (error token is ">>2) & 0x3f")
/usr/sbin/alsaconf: line 341: let: b=(( & 0x03) << 3) | (( >> 13) &

/usr/sbin/alsaconf: line 342: let: c=(>> 8) & 0x1f: syntax error:

/usr/sbin/alsaconf: line 349: let: v=((>>8)&0xff)|((&0xff)<<8): syntax
error: operand expected (error token is ">>8)&0xff)|((&0xff)<<8)")

These come from the following function:

 
# convert ISA PnP id number to string 'ABC'
convert_isapnp_id () {
    let a='('$1'>>2) & 0x3f'
    let b='(('$1' & 0x03) << 3) | (('$1' >> 13) & 0x07)'
    let c='('$1'>> 8) & 0x1f'
    strs='@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    echo ${strs:$a:1}${strs:$b:1}${strs:$c:1}
}
 
which is only called here:

    # list isapnp cards
    while read driver cardvendor carddevice data vendor func; do
        if expr $driver : 'snd-.*' >/dev/null ; then
            if [ "$last_driver" != "$driver" ]; then
                echo $driver.o
                last_driver=$driver
            fi
            id1=`convert_isapnp_id $cardvendor`
            dev1=`swap_number $carddevice`
            id2=`convert_isapnp_id $vendor`
            dev2=`swap_number $func`
            echo "ISAPNP: $id1$dev1=$id2$dev2"
        fi
    done < $MODDIR/modules.isapnpmap >> $1
}


This suggests that there's some problem with the "cardvendor" value...
but here I fall off the edge of my knowledge.

Does this look familiar, and is there a way to fix it?

| ReiserFS is very fast filesystem, but there's alot more to it than
just what file system you're using. You may want to consider several
things: 1) what is your hdparm set to? 2) Do you have the proper support
for your chipset compiled into the kernel? Just because it works doesn't
mean it's set up properly. 3) Is it a brand new type of controller? The
drivers for it may still be a work in progress and they may not
currently function the greatest. (SATA controllers on Nvidia chipsets
for instance) 4) There are other factors to consider in disk speed than
RPM, for example what size cache does it have and what is it's seek
time? 5) What other processes are running and what kind of load are they
putting on your hard drive.

I dont think so...
IMHO, reiserfs is slower than ext3

Why you are using release 0.9.0?
I have RH9 and release  0.9.5  that I downloaded a few weeks ago.  I 
checked that there is a new release 0.9.6 since end of July.

After compiling the driver, alsaconf remains under the  directory 
alsa-driver-0.9.5/utils.  It is not copied to /usr/sbin.

I think you should get latest release.

Version 2.3.0 of the GPLed  musical score editor NoteEdit is available:

  http://rnvs.informatik.tu-chemnitz.de/~jan/noteedit/noteedit.html

New features:

	- score layout : braces (piano staffs), brackets (staff groups),
			 continued/discontinued bar rules.

             Note! NoteEdit does its best to export the score layout. But
	     depending on your typesetting system the score layout possibly
	     changes (see below)

	- Hungarian GUI translation (thanks to Peter Breuer <comp-Cpc/lpkE8Z6hmC5S/q193w@public.gmane.org>)
	- end bar
	- multi repeats 

	     Note! The multi repeat influences the replay but the signature
	     is only exported to MUP.  (Perhaps some gurus can sometimes
	     explain to me how to export this into to different typesetting
	     systems).

	- UTF8 text coding in "*.not" files. This sould enable correct restore
	   of Russian (Cyrillic), Greek, Hebrew, ... texts. 

	     Note! It does not mean it exports Russian, (Cyrillic), Greek,
	     Hebrew, ... texts to MusiXTeX, LilyPond, ABC music, ...! I'm afraid
	     I'd need a native language speaker with some C++ programming
	     knowledge to solve this.

Problems exporting score layout
===============================

MusiXTeX actually accepts either completely continued or completely
         discontinued bar rules. If you specify a mix of partial
	 continued and partial discontinued bar rules NoteEdit
	 produces some statements of the musixdbr.tex package
	 by Rainer Dunker.  NoteEdit produces a warning and gives
	 advice to install this package. Otherwise MusiXTeX will fail.

PMX      is a preprocessor to MusiXTeX and therefore the same problems apply.

ABC music cannot deal with nested braces in brackets. NoteEdit will warn you.

LilyPond  can deal with braces and brackets. It changes the staff
          rules according to some LilyPond inherent rules. I was
	  told it is possible to break these rules.  But I assume
	  they are there for good reasons. NoteEdit will warn you
          if a LilyPond rule will change the staff rule policy.

MUP       has no limitations.

off topic but hilarious - the SCO 419 scam....

-------- Original Message --------

DEAR SIR/MADAM:

I AM MR. DARL MCBRIDE CURRENTLY SERVING AS THE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF
EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE SCO GROUP, FORMERLY KNOWN AS CALDERA SYSTEMS
INTERNATIONAL, IN LINDON, UTAH, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I KNOW THIS
LETTER MIGHT SURPRISE YOUR BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD NO PREVIOUS
COMMUNICATIONS OR BUSINESS DEALINGS BEFORE NOW.

MY ASSOCIATES HAVE RECENTLY MADE CLAIM TO COMPUTER SOFTWARES WORTH AN
ESTIMATED $1 BILLION U.S. DOLLARS. I AM WRITING TO YOU IN CONFIDENCE
BECAUSE WE URGENTLY REQUIRE YOUR ASSISTANCE TO OBTAIN THESE FUNDS.

IN THE EARLY 1970S THE AMERICAN TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH CORPORATION
DEVELOPED AT GREAT EXPENSE THE COMPUTER OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE KNOWN
AS UNIX. UNFORTUNATELY THE LAWS OF MY COUNTRY PROHIBITED THEM FROM
SELLING THESE SOFTWARES AND SO THEIR VALUABLE SOURCE CODES REMAINED
PRIVATELY HELD. UNDER A SPECIAL ARRANGMENT SOME PROGRAMMERS FROM THE
CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITY OF BERKELEY DID ADD MORE CODES TO THIS OPERATING
SYSTEM, INCREASING ITS VALUE, BUT NOT IN ANY WAY TO DILUTE OR DISPARAGE
OUR FULL AND RIGHTFUL OWNERSHIP OF THESE CODES, DESPITE ANY AGREEMENT
BETWEEN AMERICAN TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH AND THE CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITY
OF BERKELEY, WHICH AGREEMENT WE DENY AND DISAVOW.

IN THE YEAR 1984 A CHANGE OF REGIME IN MY COUNTRY ALLOWED THE AMERICAN
TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH CORPORATION TO MAKE PROFITS FROM THESE
SOFTWARES. IN THE YEAR 1990 OWNERSHIP OF THESE SOFTWARES WAS TRANSFERRED
TO THE CORPORATION UNIX SYSTEM LABORATORIES. IN THE YEAR 1993 THIS
CORPORATION WAS SOLD TO THE CORPORATION NOVELL. IN THE YEAR 1994 SOME
EMPLOYEES OF NOVELL FORMED THE CORPORATION CALDERA SYSTEMS
INTERNATIONAL, WHICH BEGAN TO DISTRIBUTE AN UPSTART OPERATING SYSTEM
KNOWN AS LINUX. IN THE YEAR 1995 NOVELL SOLD THE UNIX SOFTWARE CODES TO
SCO. IN THE YEAR 2001 OCCURRED A SEPARATION OF SCO, AND THE SCO BRAND
NAME AND UNIX CODES WERE ACQUIRED BY THE CALDERA SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL,
AND IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR THE CALDERA SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL WAS RENAMED
SCO GROUP, OF WHICH I CURRENTLY SERVE AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER.

MY ASSOCIATES AND I OF THE SCO GROUP ARE THEREFORE THE FULL AND RIGHTFUL
OWNERS OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARES KNOWN AS UNIX. OUR ENGINEERS
HAVE DISCOVERED THAT NO FEWER THAN SEVENTY (70) LINES OF OUR VALUABLE
AND PROPRIETARY SOURCE CODES HAVE APPEARED IN THE UPSTART OPERATING
SYSTEM LINUX. AS YOU CAN PLAINLY SEE, THIS GIVES US A CLAIM ON THE
MILLIONS OF LINES OF VALUABLE SOFTWARE CODES WHICH COMPRISE THIS LINUX
AND WHICH HAS BEEN SOLD AT GREAT PROFIT TO VERY MANY BUSINESS
ENTERPRISES. OUR LEGAL EXPERTS HAVE ADVISED US THAT OUR CONTRIBUTION TO
THESE CODES IS WORTH AN ESTIMATED ONE (1) BILLION U.S. DOLLARS.

UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY EXTRACTING OUR FUNDS FROM THESE
COMPUTER SOFTWARES. TO THIS EFFECT I HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE MANDATE BY MY
COLLEAGUES TO CONTACT YOU AND ASK FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE. WE ARE PREPARED
TO SELL YOU A SHARE IN THIS ENTERPRISE, WHICH WILL SOON BE VERY
PROFITABLE, THAT WILL GRANT YOU THE RIGHTS TO USE THESE VAULABLE
SOFTWARES IN YOUR BUSINESS ENTERPRISE. UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE NOT ABLE AT
THIS TIME TO SET A PRICE ON THESE RIGHTS. THEREFORE IT IS OUR RESPECTFUL
SUGGESTION, THAT YOU MAY BE IMMEDIATELY A PARTY TO THIS ENTERPRISE,
BEFORE OTHERS ACCEPT THESE LUCRATIVE TERMS, THAT YOU SEND US THE NUMBER
OF A BANKING ACCOUNT WHERE WE CAN WITHDRAW FUNDS OF A SUITABLE AMOUNT TO
GUARANTEE YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THIS ENTERPRISE. AS AN ALTERNATIVE YOU
MAY SEND US THE NUMBER AND EXPIRATION DATE OF YOUR MAJOR CREDIT CARD, OR
YOU MAY SEND TO US A SIGNED CHECK FROM YOUR BANKING ACCOUNT PAYABLE TO
"SCO GROUP" AND WITH THE AMOUNT LEFT BLANK FOR US TO CONVENIENTLY SUPPLY.

KINDLY TREAT THIS REQUEST AS VERY IMPORTANT AND STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL. I
HONESTLY ASSURE YOU THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS 100% LEGAL AND RISK-FREE.

After an upgrade to the suggested alsaconf, the problem remains
unchanged.

By the way, alsaconf from alsa-driver-0.9.5/utils also identifies itself
as version 0.9.0, so as far as I know there was no way to reach your
assumption about which ALSA release I was using based on the information
in my message.

Now: any suggestions as to a fix?

I have a midiman uno usb device.  I am not sure if I am using it
correctly or not.  I compiled and installed ezusb2131 and usb-midi (not
realizing usb-midi is in the kernel) I load the ezusb2131 with:
modprobe ezusb2131 vendor_id=0x763 product_id=0x110 
I then cat the firmware into the device.
I then load usb-midi.  This is how I do it manually when hotplug does
not work correctly. 
dmesg list that I have a /dev/midi02 now.

My first question is if I am setting up the above correctly?

My second question is how do I use it besides with muse, csound, and pd?

Muse does not detect the device.  I have to add a new raw midi device in
the midi configuration of muse.  That is ok but should it be detected.
I can't get it to work with other sequencers at all because most of them
don't allow you to add raw midi devices.  Now csounds and pd will listen
to a raw midi device. 

The way I have been using it is through muse. Then I set up any other
synth in muse.  

Thanks,
Jeremiah

Hello all,

I received the RME HDSP Digiface PCI card I'd ordered, but for some
reason they only sent (and charged me for) one of the two Frontier
Tango24 8-channel A/D-D/A convertors I'd requested. So, this got me
thinking "maybe I only need 8 channels of I/O, and can do the rest in
Ardour".

Many musician friends using Macs say they do most of their stuff in the
computer nowadays. One guy said he'd probably not even have a mixer,
just preamps, although how would you do headphone monitor mixes?

I was wondering what people's opinions are on this:

  Should I get the other Tango24 while they're still going cheap,
  or spend the 300 pounds elsewhere?

A long-term glint-in-the-eye idea was to one day get a CLM DB8000S:

http://www.clmdynamics.com/db8000_frame.htm

...8-channel M&S-mic-pre/limiter/A-D for input to the HDSP, so giving
16in/8out, or 24in/16out with a pair of Tango24s. But is this amount
of channels overkill for a project studio? I won't have even eight mics
for some time yet, although I will eventually need to be mixing lots of
recorded tracks.

I'm also wondering that mixing like this:

  Ardour tracks--> D/A--> mixer+FX--> A/D--> Ardour--> D/A--> monitors

...seems rather convoluted; would it compromise quality or sync (comb
filter effects, etc.) to be adding the extra A/D conversions? But I
suppose that's how everyone records to ADAT machines with analogue
desks.

However, If I can do more stuff internally in Ardour, that's good.
Trouble with that is, that I would miss the hands-on twistability of
an analogue console where each channel's parameters are laid out for
the tweaking. Can Ardour be used to route FX sends out of one ADAT
channel directly to analogue outboard, then back in again?


I don't even have a mixer yet, nor proper monitors, although the recent
'how to build a studio' thread helped lots:

http://eca.cx/lau/2003/06/0170.html


What I'd really like is a simple fader box with 16 or 24 moving faders,
and little else, to save my mouse-miles when mixing. But all the control
surfaces I've seen are either way too complicated (with lock-in unfree
software) or don't have moving faders.

Any ideas without spending $20,000 on a digital desk?

I never said ext3 was slow :)

Both are fast, and your results may vary depending on what kernel and =
subsequent patches you have. Speeds for ext3 can vary depending on what =
mode (writeback, ordered, or journaled) you are using. Even though ext3 =
is very fast, reiserfs generally has better throughput and latency =
timings in my experience, which I personally find to be much more =
important than raw read/write times when working with audio.

I don't know what desktop you use, but krecord is a (very) simple
recorder with 2 types of graphic level meters. Although, all you can do
is Record, Playback and save the WAV to disk. There's no way to edit the 
  WAV once you record it. But I use it when I just want to do a quick 
recording. It also has a "Record Trigger" so You can press Record and it 
wont start recording until it hears sound. It offers different trigger 
levels for whatever job you need to do. And it allows you to choose from 
8 bit, 16 bit, Mono, Sterio and a variety of sampling rates.

I guess the question is how many tracks will you ever need to record at
once in realtime? i.e. you have 8 mics, a synthesizer, a DI box or
two...what else? Of course I can't make this decision for you, but how
large will your "project studio" projects be? 10 piece salsa band? 3 piece
rock combo? Jazz quartet? But in the end, the only use for many physical
inputs with a digital system is the ability to record to many tracks in
realtime. After that it's just overdubs and post.

If you are using jack, then meterbridge is what you want.

If you are not using jack, you should consider switching since meterbridge
is what you want.

I used it all weekend. (Thanks Steve!)

BTW - do you really want vu meters? Or do you possibly want dpm type meters?
meterbridge offers both and more.

Thanks for reporting this problem. I considered QARecord to be a rock solid
stereo recording solution. I have recorded hours of multilayered synthesizer
music at home with QARecord. Although the length of the single tracks was
only 2-6 min., I can not imagine any problems when recording more than
several minutes.

QARecord indeed records to RAM, but this is only a large ringbuffer to
prevent the audio capture from overrunning in case of disc write delays.
QARecord should start writing to disc several milliseconds after the
recording is started.

I'm very interested in resolving this problem. Can you therefore tell me:

1) Which version of QARecord are you using (0.0.9) ?
2) Are you using JACK mode ? (I use JACK mode only occasionally.)
3) What buffering numbers are displayed in the status line ?
4) What hardware are you using (soundcard, CPU speed) ?

I assume that somehow the "handshaking" between the capture thread and the
disc writer thread does not work on your system. Let's find out, why.

yes.


Not for that session.


No idea for that session. I haven't tested since. (see below)


It was with an rme multiface. cpu 1 ghz celeron. kernel 2.4.21 (low 
lat). gcc-2.95.4.


It could also be a driver problem but I'm guessing we would have heard 
from others by now if the multiface couldn't record long sessions. Maybe 
I need to test that side of things too.

The one thing that makes me feel it is a qarecord problem is the 
countdown which happened when I pressed stop. Why would it do that? It 
finished on 1024 BTW and then I had to close the app. I can't remember 
if it stop responding before I closed it.

QARecord works like this:

1) Audio thread captures data from soundcard and stores it in ringbuffer.
2) Disc writer thread reads data from ringbuffer and writes it to disc.
3) There is a shared structure that holds a variable "validByteCount".
   These are the numbers of bytes that are captured and not yet written
   to disc.

One captured period increases validByteCount by periodsize * framesize.
One written cycle reduces validByteCount by WAVBUFSIZE=4096 bytes.

If for any reason the thread coordination does not work properly, the
writer thread does not write and the validByteCount keeps rising.
When you press "Stop", the capture thread is stopped and the remaining
validByteCount bytes are written to disc. These should however not be more
than at most 1 MB, not several minutes.

BTW I use gcc 3.3 here.

Hi all

I believe this question is an old one, but can someone show me the best way to find the ideal size an number of audio buffers of my sound card.
I have read lot of web pages on this subject, but I didn't understand everything, although I use linux audio apps for years now. I always end trying one by one the values until I found an acceptable one (for example, the fluidsynth configuration). The problem is, each time I had to use another PC, I don't know how to quickly find this values.

I remember years ago, Cubase was testing the sound card to find the best values (something about ASIO drivers).
Is there a Linux app that can deduce this values?

Hi

I just installed kernel 2.6.0-test3 on my laptop. I looked around in
/proc and saw all kinds of promissing things showing up there.
/var/log/messages even showed my Evolution USB keyboard. Very nice. But
since I'm fairly new to the kernel2.6.0/build-in-ALSA I'm hoping for
some pointers just to get started.

1) I didn't do any configuration of ALSA. Is that needed? If so how do I
do it now that ALSA is compiled in?

2) Where can I expect my devices to show up? For now I have an onboard
soundcard (i810) and the Evolution keyboard. I would like to route the
incomming midi to csound, but later also to either Muse or Rosegarden4.
Is that a matter of having the softsynth or sequencer read from
/dev/midi00 (or somthing like that)? And do I simply tell the sound
generating software to direct its output to the appropriate device, say
/dev/audio?

3) I noticed somethiing jack showing up. Is jack supported? If so, to
what extend?

4) What would be a nice program use for figuring out what midi-events
the knobs on the Evolution sends?

Hope some of you could find the time to either explain me a bit or send
me in direction of some useful documentation. Thanks in advance.

If Alsa is running, then lsmod will show you the sound modules you are
running from /etc/modules.conf. lspci should show you what hardware the
system is seeing.


Possibly under /proc/asound, but this is a 2.4.X model. I've not used 2.6
yet.


man jackd I think.


Don't know. I hope we get an answer! Certainly Rosegarden should be able to
record and show you MIDI events if MIDI is working.

Pure-Data (PD) is able to do this.  i have just purchaced an Evolution 
UC33, and that is what I used to determine what it sends, even though the 
controllers are reprogrammable.

Hallo,

I

I think, that ALSA normally still  builds as modules. It depends on
your setup, but I would build modules. Then you just configure it like
old alsa, but I think the file locations have changed in 2.6, i.e. no
/etc/modules.conf anymore. It should be explained in modules.txt or
such in the Documentation folder. Sorry for this vague info, but I'm
still running a 2.4 kernel.


Software that uses the ALSA sequencer (RG4, MusE) should need no
further tools, but for software, that uses raw-midi devices (Ardour,
Csound) you need a virmidi-device and route with aconnect. See the
Midi-Howto or the Softsynth-Sequencer-Quicktoot for that.


As mentioned, Pd does this. YOu don't even need to learn Pd: Just open
the "Test audio and midi" help file from the Pd menu.=20

The only difference between 2.2/2.4 and 2.6 is that you don't need to
compile/install the alsa-driver package.

You still need some entries in modules.conf and to install the
alsa-lib and alsa-utils packages. These things are exactly the same as
in 2.2/2.4, so you probably already have them. If not, have a look at
the ALSA website.

Your modules.conf entries would look somewhat like this:

	options snd cards_limit=3D2

	alias snd-card-0 snd-intel8x0
	options snd-intel8x0 index=3D0

	alias snd-card-1 snd-usb-audio
	options snd-usb-audio index=3D1

	# maybe third entry if the mainboard has a MIDI/game port

	# OSS emulation entries omitted

It may be possible that your hotplug scripts try to load the OSS
driver (usb-midi) for the keyboard. In this case, add usb-midi to the
/etc/hotplug/blacklist file.


These device files are used for OSS emulation only. ALSA devices are
accessed through the ALSA library.

Audio devices have names like "hw:0,0" or "plughw:0,0" (the numbers
are card and device numbers). For a list of devices, run "aplay -l" or
"arecord -l".

MIDI sequencer ports have names like "72:0" (client and port number).
For a list of ports, run "aconnect -io".


This is probably the usb-midi driver. These messages tell you about
the presence of MIDI jacks, and aren't related to the Jack Audio
Connection Kit.


Yes. Just like in other kernel versions.

Hi all!

Some time ago I asked at this list whether Audigy 2
soundcard works with hardware sound generation. The answer
was: "Yes!"

Today I tried:

	sfxload 8mbgmsfx.sf2

A soundfont which always worked with SB AWE 64.
But surprising: The command works only 1 second. The
tse3play -list detects 7 MIDI devices:

------- Port number: 63
                 Type: ALSA MIDI port
                 Name: Receiver 63:0
  ------- Port number: 64
                 Type: ALSA MIDI port
                 Name: Audigy MPU-401 (UART) 64:0
  ------- Port number: 65
                 Type: ALSA MIDI port
                 Name: Audigy MPU-401 #2 64:32
  ------- Port number: 66
                 Type: ALSA MIDI port
                 Name: Emu10k1 Port 0 65:0
  ------- Port number: 67
                 Type: ALSA MIDI port
                 Name: Emu10k1 Port 1 65:1
  ------- Port number: 68
                 Type: ALSA MIDI port
                 Name: Emu10k1 Port 2 65:2
  ------- Port number: 69
                 Type: ALSA MIDI port
                 Name: Emu10k1 Port 3 65:3


I can play via all of these 3 devices with diffenet MIDI
players. But unfortunataly I can't hear anything.

I tried all rulers on alsamixer and deleted the
"M" symbols on to of these rulers: Nothing helps.

Any sugestions? Should I run "sfxload" with a certain
option?

At Wed, 13 Aug 2003 20:45:38 +0200 (CEST),

first, please try the latest driver (0.9.6) for audigy2.
there have been some important changes for this card.

if you can already hear a normal PCM sound via aplay, then it's likely
a mixer problem.  raise "Music" volume via alsamixer if not yet.



no, not necessary as long as the audigy is the first card...

Ok, I admit it; I cannot figure out how to setup ALSA :-)

I *did* read alot of examples (on the ALSA wiki, in the evolution USB
MIDI Howto and the asoundrc.txt included with ALSA 0.9.6). Although I
think I understand the examples, I can't produce a working .asoundrc
myself. So much for the appologies, hope someone would be kind enough to
help me create a config file that would enable me to get midi into the
system. I'd also appreciate some pointers to relevant reading where the
concepts in ALSA are explained.

So far I compiled all relevant ALSA modules in the kernel (2.6.0-test3),
including emulation of OSS mixer, pcm and seq. Now sound is working
almost fine (PD doesn't love using the ALSA output, but csound, play,
xmms and alsaplayer works flawlessly). But I cannot make *any* program
recieve midi from the Evolution USB keyboard. I can't even get a reading
in either pd or aseqview. I run debian/unstable so there's no such thing
as /etc/modules.conf. It's was /etc/modutils/alsa, but now I moved it
out of the way. Instead I figured I'd start with ~/.asoundrc, since I
believe they should be the same. So for now, no config file is present.

Here's what aconnect -io says with the keyboard plugged in:
client 0: 'System' [type=kernel]
    0 'Timer           '
    1 'Announce        '
client 72: 'Rawmidi 1 - MK-249C USB MIDI keyboard' [type=kernel]
    0 'MK-249C USB MIDI keyboard Port '

Thought that connecting the > of 'Rawmidi 1 - MK-249C USB MIDI keyboard'
to < of 'MIDI Viewer - Viewer port 0' in aconnectgui would result in
readings in aseqview, but no :-( Also tried to connect the < og the
keyboard to > of the viewer, same result.

Here's what shows up in /var/log/messages when I plug in the Evolution:

Hi all,

I asked this question on the alsa-user list but haven't received a reply
so I thought I would ask here.

I have two ENS1371 based cards plugged into the one machine:

    root@sound:~# cat /proc/asound/cards
    0 [AudioPCI       ]: ENS1371 - Ensoniq AudioPCI
                         Ensoniq AudioPCI ENS1371 at 0xa400, irq 10
    1 [AudioPCI_1     ]: ENS1371 - Ensoniq AudioPCI
                         Ensoniq AudioPCI ENS1371 at 0x9400, irq 5

I have also set up a /etc/asound.conf file containing aliases for the
cards named "card0" and "card1".

I have also run alsamixergui with "-c 0" and "-c 1" parameters to set up
output volumes on the two cards (and the controls on the two alsamixergui
instances behave independantly).

However, when I playback a sound file using:

    aplay -D card0 a.wav
    aplay -D card1 a.wav

Only card0 produces sound. I have also tried physically swapping the cards
but only card0 produces sound. I have also tried the -v option to aplay to
confirm that the output is going to device 0 and device 1.

I'm out of ideas about this. Does anybody have any hints on how I might
get this going?

Thanks,
Erik

Hello all,

I've got an odd one here - I'm trying to upgrade ALSA on a Mandrake 
9.1 box. I did this before on another (upgraded to 0.9.2) and it 
worked fine, but on this one upgrading the RPMs seems to have no 
effect.

I installed these RPMs with urpmi:

libalsa2-0.9.5-1mdk.i586.rpm
libalsa-data-0.9.5-1mdk.i586.rpm
kernel-multimedia-source-2.4.21-0.16mdk.i586.rpm

But if I do:

service alsa restart

I get:

Shutting down ALSA sound driver (version 0.9.0rc8):  [  OK  ]
Starting ALSA version 0.9.0rc8: cs46xx.                       [  OK  ]

I've tried rebooting.

Any clues? Have I missed something obvious here?

Thanks

Currently, there isn't much to be configured for MIDI device plugins,
so you don't need an .asoundrc for your keyboard.


modules.conf has nothing to do with the ~/.asoundrc file. The former
tells modprobe how to load modules and where to find them, the latter
tells ALSA about user-defined plugins.

d:008e, iface 1
rd at usb-0000:00:03.1-2

The log messages are from the OSS usb-midi driver. /proc/asound/cards
shows that ALSA's snd-usb-audio is loaded. You now have two drivers
trying to access the same device.

Please add the following lines to the /etc/hotplug/blacklist file to
prevent the OSS drivers from loading:

audio
usb-midi

Ok, that makes sense...


Actually I had to remove it from the kernel. Quite confusing IMHO, I woul=

Now everything works:

play the keyboard
 *Csound can be driven from /dev/midi1
 *PD (which I never used) recieves midi data if started with '-midiindev =

Hello all,

I've been asked by an animatronics technician for suggestions as how 
they might go about solving a particular problem with a robot parrot 
at a local theme park.

The robot's voice feature was designed around a PC/Windows platform 
using Cool Edit Pro and scripted in Visual Basic. The idea is that 
you say something to the parrot, it pitch shifts your voice then 
repeats what you said two seconds later. If no-one talks to the 
parrot for a while, it says "hello, my name is Sancho, talk to me". 
Needless to say, they are having severe reliability problems with 
Windows as it is being used day in, day out.

Can anyone suggest a suitable Linux solution for this parrot? I was 
thinking about ecasound combined with a pitch shift plugin, if one 
exists. If the solution could run entirely in RAM (CD booting, 
perhaps?) then that would solve the problem of hard disk reliability.
 
Thanks

Daniel

Where did you get these RPMs?
I assume you're running Mandrake 9.1?
If those are cooker RPMs, they need to be rebuilt on your 9.1 system 
first.

The alsa driver itself is in the RPM "kernel" or "kernel-multimedia".
To upgrade, I'd suggest this:
Go to http://mandrake.redbox.cz/Mandrake-devel/cooker/SRPMS/
Download the kernel, kernel-utils, and libalsa2 SRPMs.  Rebuild them 
with "rpm --rebuild".  The RPMs will end up in /usr/src/RPM/RPMS/i586.  
Install kernel-utils first, then the other two.

You can also find the latest multimedia kernel in
http://mandrake.redbox.cz/Mandrake-devel/contrib/SRPMS
but I don't think it has alsa 0.9.6 yet.  (can't remember)

Mandrake 9.2 beta3 should be out very soon, and it includes ALSA 
0.9.6.  If you have time to test it, it would be a very big help to us.
If you have more problems with your RPM upgrade, let me know.

Hi,


I'm usning the latest alsa drivers (0.9.6), and
I'm trying to get understand this snd-virmidi stuff:

http://linux-sound.org/quick-toots/4-sequencers_and_softsynths/quick-toot-midisynth_howto.html

When I try:
modprobe snd-virmidi

I get:
modprobe: Can't locate module snd-virmidi

I have searched my /lib/modules/<kernel-version>/kernel/sound/* for it.
Its not there.

Is there a switch I have to put in when I "./configure" my alsa-driver ?
(to get the "snd-virmidi" module)

I *do* have the "snd-seq-virmidi" loaded.
Whats the relation between "snd-virmidi" and "snd-seq-virmidi" ? 

I've done searches and LAD & LAU for "snd-virmidi", but nothing 
comes up about it "missing".

##

Any pointers would be appreciated.
If my post is lacking pertinent details, I can elaborate.

thanks,

I would recommend programming a custom solution using Pure Data (PD).
You can use RAM buffers for the recording and playback. PD has an
internal timekeeping system so you can set a timeout for the default
messages. PD is cool because it's a graphical language based on boxes
and patch cords, so you don't need to memorize very much syntax.

/*
 * VIRTUAL RAW MIDI DEVICE CARDS

 * This dummy card contains up to 4 virtual rawmidi devices.

 * Also, multiple access is allowed to a single rawmidi device.
 *
 * Typical usage is like following:
 * - Load snd-virmidi module.
 *      # modprobe snd-virmidi index=2
 *   Then, sequencer clients 72:0 to 75:0 will be created, which are
 *   mapped from /dev/snd/midiC1D0 to /dev/snd/midiC1D3, respectively.
 *
 * - Connect input/output via aconnect.
 *      % aconnect 64:0 72:0    # keyboard input redirection 64:0 -> 72:0
 *      % aconnect 72:0 65:0    # output device redirection 72:0 -> 65:0
 *
 * - Run application using a midi device (eg. /dev/snd/midiC1D0)

 Thank you! This helped! But there is still a small problem:
 The MIDI sound is send via a different output than the
 PCM sound.

 I assume this has to do with some routing capabilities
 of the Ausdigy2. Is there a Linux tool to change this.

Oh, nice, I went to a zoo with my children once, they had a parrot just like 
that, they thought it was immensely funny :).

Any of the shelf distro would probably suffice. For reliability I would 
propose using a Flash disk. fast, small, clean, reliable, inexpensive. 
There are heaps of small, cheap motherboards these days that have built in 
sound so that won't be a problem.

As for solutions to the actual problem...
I'm not entirely sure... 
You'd want to 'sniff' the data continuously at the same time as you loop it 
around and pitchshift it to the output...

It would probably be easiest to do a small c program which utilized some 
ladspa plugins for the pitchshift, probably noise gate and, possibly the 
delay.

I'm having a hard time figuring out how to do it with off the shelf tools 
though, since it involves doing several things in parallell.. .

But there is probably some obvious way that I'm ignoring :)

Btw, It's always nice with real life applications of open source tools!

Flash disks wear out much quicker than HD's do. I would go with a normal
IDE HD and set it to spin down under power management.
 

Yup, you could knock up something with ecasound and some sort of scripting
language (I think there are perl and python bindings).

Alternativly pd would be a good coice, or writing a jack client in C would
be pretty easy if you can find a volunteer.

lee suggested PD, i would suggest SuperCollider.

i have written many supercollider patches to do this sort of thing, 
but these are all in Mac - i'm still getting to the point of 
compiling SC in linux in my "free time" (tm). (though closer now, 
with debian unstable +alsa running on an older ppc!)

anyway, in either app:

one continuously running loop that tests (say every 0.1 second) for 
an input volume threshold, which, if crossed, starts a timer and 
starts writing to a buffer.
my SC versions write start and stop sample numbers into an array to 
be accessed later.

second, a loop that tests if there any sample in the buffer, and 
plays back accordingly, at rate*2 or whatever, or fft i guess if you 
want to shift pitch and not rate.

third a loop that plays the default sample if nothing else is playing..


hope that helps somewhat...

No, but you can define althernate names in /etc/asound.conf or ~/.asoundrc.
I've done mine in /etc/asound.conf.


Yes I did and thats no better.

The od thing is that aplay does correctly pick up that I am trying to play
out of "Hardware PCM card 1" instead of "Hardware PCM card 0" but stil no

For those of you who are interested in dj tools or tools for live
performance, Steve Harris has made a new plugin called DJ EQ which is a 
three band EQ commonly found on dj mixing consoles. It's
currently only available in the snapshots directory.

You may also be interested in a new app we are creating based on the
code from JAMin. It's called jackEQ.

http://sf.net/projects/jackeq. No webpage yet and only cvs.

It is in its infancy but it already connects to JACK and has a one 
channel (multiple i/o via qjackconnect) EQ and meter.

I would like it to be able to do all these things eventually:

unlimited channels.
jack port connection ala freq tweak style
route signal to monitor if monitor button is toggled for channel
independant monitor gain control (with meter) and output to alternate 
alsa_pcm:outs

With the above I could use my four channel card as a complete djing tool
. You could also use a two channel card in a similar (mono) way.

The monitor will be assignable to seperate output channels than the main 
outs. All the channels can be routed to it if needed. The eq's are all 
adjusted before the signal arrives at the monitor.

This is how I intend to use it:

It might be your modules.conf settings.

Because the devices are the same you may need to specify a sound card 
limit in the alsa section.

I have SuperCollider 3 server compiled on my Gentoo box. I've been using
SC since 2.2. Actually, it is the only piece of commercial software I've
ever felt was worth the money. Since it's source code opening and the
language and the server separating I haven't done much with it. I'm led
to believe the SC language is compiled separately from the server, which
I have compiled with JACK support.

However, for something as simple as programming a talking robot parrot,
I would expect PD to be much more straight forward.

yup:  you have to include it in your "--with-cards=" switch.

Hi all
I am wondering if anybody can recommend software that is capable of 
producing a high quality organ sound, preferably like that of a Hammond B3. 
It doesn't have to have heaps of controls, but something that I can modify 
on the fly to make texture changes in the sound. Support for 
LADSPA/JACK/Pure-Data/MIDI is preferable.

Alternatively, does anybody know of any good quality soundfonts and/or 
samples that would fulfill this task?

Thanks

Thanks for the response, Austin - after posting I figured out that 
Mandrake builds the alsa-driver package into its kernels, unlike the 
other ALSA packages which are seperate RPMs. 

I'm even more confused now about how I managed this on the other 
machine...


I am planning to test 9.2 - I think Mandrake does a great job of 
balancing the latest software with user friendliness. It would be 
easier not to be on the bleeding edge sometimes, but Linux audio is 
developing so fast it would be a shame to miss out on the new stuff.
 
Cheers!

What do you want to acheieve?

gdam is very advanced  (supports beat matching and multiple sound cards).
terminatorX is excellent and now has (working) jack support in cvs.
alsaplayer is a reasonable sampler (with playlist).

There are a few fx/synths that can be used as fx racks too.

A couple of us are currently working on a new app which aims to provide 
a DJ(like) mixer for any jack app.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/jackeq

It's feasible that the code could be extended to support beat matching. 
Just need some time and testers/developers.

If you're after the truly authentic Hammond sound, any soundfont or 
sample is likely to disapoint. Unless you've got a Leslie speaker on 
your Linux box, maybe? : )

There is another soundfont on that page marked OB-3, plus a Farfisa 
soundfont. There is also a second page of soundfonts if you click at 
the end of that page. I don't think they are bad for free-as-in-beer 
samples.
 
Cheers

Yes.  I've been working hard to make sure a recent and working alsa is part of 
9.2, and I only have about two weeks left to do so.

As of last night, I believe all alsa-related packages are 0.9.6, and 
everything seems to be working well except my M-Audio Quattro, which works 
with alsa build from source, but not with the driver included with the 
kernel.  I'm working on a solution though.

Everything else is up-to-date as well I believe.  Ardour beta3, audacity, 
muse, swami, fluidsynth, all of Holborn's stuff, the multimedia kernel, and a 
fancy new GUI for jack, etc. etc.

I still haven't managed to figure out a way to get csound in, but I figure 
that anyone smart enough to be able to actually USE csound will also be smart 
enough to know how to install it.  :-)

Hi!
  If you aren't afraid of using csound, then there is a very nice
b3-emulation. Just go Dave Phillips' page at http://linux-sound.org, then
click csound & cmix and then "csound page by yours truly" or something like
that. There he has some links to sco/orc files. There is one sound, which is
designed to be used with midi. He has also provied a demo-file. It sounded
indeed very convincing to me. And there you have a lesslie. :-)

Hi,

After reading an article about Linux and music in Sound On Sound recently, 
I thought I'd take the plunge and begin moving my music studio to Linux. 
Currently I'm using an Athlon XP-based PC and a PowerMac 7600/200. The PC 
contains a Hoontech DSP24 Value card and an MPU-401 style MIDI interface 
that I put together myself. The Mac contains a Yamaha SW1000 card and an 
Opcode MIDI interface. My main music software is Cubase, although I've used 
tons of other music software over the years.

The main programs I'm interested using are Rosegarden and Ardour, although 
I'm also interested in looking at some of the softsynth stuff too.

I work as a technical writer and have written some music software for Mac 
and PC (CS1 Background Edit) so I'm fairly computer literate. However, I 
have no experience with Linux.

Initially, I installed Debian on my PC, however it didn't get along with my 
TFT monitor. I've since bought Red Hat 9.0. Which I'm just about to 
install. Hopefully it will be a bit easier to use!

Before I begin the installation I was wondering if someone could fill me in 
on the current state of ALSA. I've had a quick look at some of the How-Tos 
however I'm not clear on how up-to-date they are.

I'm currently looking at getting a new soundcard--the Hoontech was really 
only a temporary measure to get sound out of the PC. Unfortunately, it 
seems that the SW1000 won't ever be supported so it's not much use.

I'd like a card with balanced 24-bit analog I/O and SPDIF I/O. The MiaMIDI 
card seems to have these features. Does anyone have experience with this 
card on a Linux system?

I also thought that a Delta66 would be suitable too.

Cheers,

Chris Share

Welcome

Sounds familiar! 

Great programs to start with. Having shosen them you seem to know about
Jack at this point, so that's good.


Much easier, in the sense that you have a really great resource at your
service - Planet CCRMA - totally easy to bring up all of these apps in a
single evening using the service that Standford and Fernando provide.

http://ccrma-www.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/


Alsa will be installed for you under the Planet flow. Fernando keeps it
quite up to date.


I'll let others help you there. I'm using RME cards, but I use external
A/D-D/A

Best of luck. It's a fun, but brave new world.

Cheers,
Mark

I've got a Delta-66 and recommend it highly.  It's a good-sounding

Hi Mark,

Thanks for the info. I've already had a look at Planet CCRMA. Once I get 
Red Hat up and running it'll be my first port of call!

Cheers,

Mark is right on here about PlanetCCRMA, Fernando keeps a very clean
shop and he is also an excellent source of help when you need it...and
you will need it :)

I have used various M-audio cards under Linux and found them to be
rather foolproof.  In our studio we have two machines with 1010's and
one with an OmniStudio (Delta 66 plus I/O box) that run flawlessly. 
Cards like these with the envy24 chipset also have a nice envy24control
panel which gives you access to mixer levels, clock source select,
sampling rate, route selection, etc, everything the M$/Mac version does
(your Hoontech card might also have the envy24 chip? I know the
Soundtrack DSP 24 does).

Another box (dual boot laptop) has an RME HDSP Multiface which I have
not used under Linux for a while, but there have been some exciting
recent developments for this card, including a TotalMix clone (see
RME's page).  It might be worth checking into.

OK. The noteedit docs say to set the environment variables QTDIR and 
KTEDIR to the "path to your Qt installation" and "path to your KDE 
installation" respectively.  Those don't appear to be set by default, 
and looking around on groups.google.com turns up a thread that says KDE 
no longer uses KDEDIR or KDEDIRS, but instead there's a program called 
kde-config that should be used instead.

 From running "rpm -ql qt" I'm guessing that I should set QTDIR to 
/usr/lib/qt-3.1, but it's rather less clear what I should set KDEDIR to.

Looking around for kde-config options, I infer that KDEDIR should be set 
to what

    kde-config --path ???

outputs where one of the possible "type" values replaces ???, but it's 
not clear to me, even after looking at the configure script, what the 
intent is. Any help would be appreciated. (Also, shouldn't the configure 
script be changed to use kde-config itself, if KDEDIR is obsolete?)

Hi,

Wednesday 20 August 2003 05:20 skrev Chris Share:

First, I'd ask you to go slow with moving your music to linux. You _are_ going 
to have problems, probably lots of problems. In my opinion it is worth it 
though, just for the freedom.

Myself I use Linux 24-7 nowdays, (okay, perhaps not that much, I atleast sleep 
sometimes ;) ) but it has taken a lot of time to move my audio stuff to linux 
(read years). 

A friend of mine started a similar, full scale move, a few months ago, with a 
very agressive schedule, I think he actually has fared quite well this far.
his page: http://computerville.homeip.net/audio/hostile17/

You may want to try out MusE also, it's pretty much a clone of Cubase, makes 
you feel right at home :)

http://muse.seh.de

It's not as stable as newer versions of Cubase, but imho it's one of the best 
in Linux.


<...>

The hoontech isn't bad per se, but I think it has problems with noise.

Any envy24 based card is good (which the DSP24 is), those that have external 
AD/DA are in general great.

The envy24 cards are quite well supported in Linux, I'm not sure if there are 
differences that cause some of the cards to work better or worse, you'd 
better check the alsa-lists/site for this kind of info.

Robert

Hallo,


The Planet is RedHat only, but actually I don't really miss anything
in Debian, because I use testing/unstable. There are several people
who do great jobs on keeping the Debian audio side up to date:
unstable has Ardour beta3, Csound GPL, Pd 0.37, the current MusE,
kernel-2.6 beta and much more. Later the developments of Demudi/Agnula
will flow back into Debian, so I'm confident that all will stay well
here.

[re: Csound and my examples]


Hi all:

  I appreciate the pointers to my pages, but alas, they aren't exactly
up-to-date (although the Linux Csound page is better maintained). I'll
attempt to answer the original query in a Csound context:

   You can easily design a GEN table such as the following:

that will make a somewhat organ-ish sound. And yes indeed, it can be
triggered via MIDI for realtime performance. However, if you're going
the Csound route I suggest taking a look at Josep Comajuncosas'
DirectHammond CSD file. It's a realtime instrument with an FLTK
interface, you can check it out at Josep's site at csounds.com:

	http://www.csounds.com/jmc/index.htm

Lots of interesting stuff there. Note that Josep writes his instruments
for Gabriel Maldonado's DirectCsound, a version of Csound for Windows,
but they can usually be adapted to work with either canonical Csound or
the Varga versions.

  You might also want to check out Horgand:

	http://personal.telefonica.terra.es/web/soudfontcombi/horgand.html

which also requires FLTK but is a standalone instrument, i.e. it does
not require Csound or any other synthesis app. It's also JACK-aware, a
nice touch.

It should work, because the software should be XFree86, same as any 
other distribution. Only the configuration tools usually vary between 
distributions.

Did you try lowering the refresh rate? My TFT panel won't refresh 
nearly as fast as my old CRT monitor, so when I first plugged in the 
flat panel it didn't work with X either. I had to re-run the 
configuration tool first.


You should find that easier to install than Debian if you're new to 
Linux. I suggest you set up the machine for the Planet CCRMA packages 
after installation - that will give you ALSA and everything else you 
need:

When I answered Chris last night I didn't want to be the first to say this,
but Robert is right. Go slow and make sure you invest your time
appropriately and in the right areas. I started out last September to do
pretty much what you are suggesting. I use Pro Tools. I never have enough
tracks. Their closed spec hardware solutions are expensive, so I wanted to
move to Linux. Great idea, but I had two major problems:

1) I chose the wrong hardware for my time schedule. After 3 months playing
around with motherboard sound chips and running Alsa, I decided on RME
hardware since it would be a great solution if I fell back to Nuendo or
Cubase SX. The Linux driver development guys said the HDSP 9652 wasn't
supported, but it would be easy to support. I got that card in December
2002. I am happy to report that as of this last weekend, yes fully 7 months
later, I finally have a working driver and a mixer that works with the card!
(Ta da!!!!) The point being, make *very* sure your hardware is REALLY
supported, and that there is a developer that is ACTIVELY supporting it,
meaning he's using it daily and depends on the card. If you don't have that,
then you have nothing much IMO.

2) I am a user of BOTH MIDI and audio. Rosegarden is pretty much MIDI only.
Their audio solution won't begin to match what you are used to on the PC
side. Ardour is completely audio. It has no MIDI solution. The main point is
that this has not changed much since last September, so I don't expect it to
change very quickly. I could be wrong, but I don't expect it. Linux
developers are generally unpaid and things don't move as fast as the $$$
world.

I think that Muse is a very capable program, and really the only solution
today IF you depend on BOTH audio and MIDI. It's interface isn't too bad,
although I always feel like I'm in an Excel spreadsheet trying to make music
when I use it, but it's a well designed program for what it is.

On my side I've given up completely, for the foreseeable future, using Linux
as the main creative platform. I need Pro Tools or Cubase SX/SL to do what I
want to do. However, I am using Linux as an amazingly wonderful audio
routing and mixing platform between all my sound sources and PCs, as well as
utilizing a lot of really great little processing apps (freqtweak, tapiir
and Jamin) along with Linux soft synths.

As Robert said, go slow, don't set your immediate goals too high, and make
sure the tools are really designed to do what you need them to do. The good
Linux tools are really great!

Cheers,
Mark





-->><<--__-->><<--

It's fair to say that Linux *audio* developers aren't generally paid 
to work on their audio applications, but that doesn't mean they 
aren't professional developers of course.


I think that depends what you're comparing it to. Cubase has a very 
long head start!

A fair, but fine, distinction. Point taken. I think you would agree that as
they are not paid to develop this specific group of applications we users
basically take what we get when it's given.

Please don't take me wrong. If you knew how many requests we Pro Tools users
have made of the paid DigiDesign programming staff, and how few had been
filled, you would understand that my comments are maybe not quite as
negative as you might have taken them. ;-)

Amen. Related anecdote: 
I used to own a Yamaha SU700 looping sampler, a very powerful
but difficult and ultimately frustrating box. I met a Yamaha rep at
the AES show a year or two ago, and he was demoing the RS7000
which replaced the SU700.  I mentioned that one of my big complaints
with the SU700 is that you have to stop all output while sampling
so it's impossible do any on-the-fly sampling or work in realtime
with live musicians. He cut me off and said "No audience wants to
watch you sample" and had no interest in what I wanted to do with
their samplers.

This was the last straw for me. There was an active SU700 user's group
online and we had a whole list of feature requests for Yamaha.
Several members were in repeated contact with people at Yamaha.
We got nowhere with them. They just didn't care. Their attitude was
that after all the R&D money they'd spent, they knew what we needed
and we had to like it or lump it.

After this experience I resolved that I would never again buy any
"closed" device. I don't care about the money anymore; give me
free as in freedom!

I've been really impressed overall with how much linux audio developers
care about their end users and are willing to work with them.

Hello,
i am working quite intense on lerning ARDOUR by doing. Using its beta i
exrerience some bugs that are more or less tolerablein such great an App
for no cost (crashes when trying some adventurous routing-stuff, some
lesser gui-issues).
After all there are only 2 really serious problems:

1.)Importing .wav-files fails too often (regardless if these files are
written by Samplitude, Audacity, rezound or even Ardour itself)

How is that on your setups out there?

2.)Many xruns, (some after 2 seconds, others after 2 mins, mostly within
40 secs or so - sometimes i had testrecordings of unbroken 10 minutes)

I use Ardour on SuSE 8.2 pro with jack0.74 as root only on runlevel 3 in
Windowmaker, all networking is off, no kdeinit is running.

System is:
Athlon XP 1800, 512MB DDR, 60GB Samsung HD/IDE, Terratec EWX 24/96 

I think about
 wether i buy another IDE-HD and spread the installation on 2 disks to
get more bandwith 
 or getting another 512 RAM to let Jack run without HD
 or investing in a SCSI-HD for installation and Projects and using the
IDE-Disk for Archiving only.

What would you prefer, how are your Experiences about this
Bandwithissues?

Thank you

Many similar problems earlier. I haven't used the program since it went to
it's first release. I expect its gotten better.


I somehow doubt this is due to your hardware. More likely it's some set of
interactions between the software that is running on your machine, or
possibly the way you have your hardware configured. I would really try to
understand this before you spend another penny, or you're likely to spend
many dollars and make no forward progress.

Overall, I would suggest that most xrun problems are caused by latency
issues, and not by raw bandwidth until you get to the point where you are
running many, many audio tracks. I think you are not at that point yet.

Many things can effect this:

1) Gnome/KDE are compicated environments. For test purposes at least try
something like fluxbox which runs almost nothing by defualt. (I don't know
windowmaker - it may be pretty minimal already.)

2) Look at how you have your existing hardware installed and configured. Are
you sharing interrupts? Are you using APIC, APIC-IO or ACPI? All of these
can have major effects.

3) Test your existing hard drive/drives for bandwidth capabilities. (hdparm
or Benno's disk test programs)

4) Do your xruns correspond to other things happening on the PC?

Best of luck in finding the solution. Folks are here to help.

 Windowmaker has its own sound server, extensions like meters and mixers

 I think Gnome and Kde pretty nice but maybe a bit more oriented to office

Hi,


I think a development worth observing is Jack O'Quin's
jack_transport work. As jack clients incorporate his
work syncronization of clients should become drop dead
easy.

What I find encouraging about linux based audio is the
freedom--not the free of financial costs. In a free
development model users are encouraged to request that
their favorite jack clients incorporate
jack_transport. When developers don't place a priority
on requested features cash donations can be offered.

These cash donations are excellent investments because
they inherit the attached freedom and become available
to everyone. As the user community grows, more
features should be requested and paid for.

I don't think linux audio solutions are all things to
all people, yet! However, I am hopeful that
developments during the next couple years will cause
us to become more productive and creative than the
proprietary communities.

I think jackd and libsndfile are excellent testaments
for the practicality of freedom. It's encouaging to
see developers of distinct solutions work towards
common interests.

My partners and I have four distinct production
systems in our studio; 32 track ADAT, standalone
hdr/daw, mac-digital performer and linux. We've owned
several other tape based solutions. As an engineer
studio owner, the only one I am inspired to invest
time and money into is linux. My partners and I have
been running our studio since 1983/84. During that
time I never had a developer give me any meaningful
time until I stumbled upon the linux audio community.

I think linux audio will become more immediately
gratifying with time. Meanwhile, it requires vision
and persistance.


Mark, what about syncing ardour and rosegarden or
other midi apps? That's my intention. I suspect this
will be feasible soon. Have you been following the
jack_transport developments? BTW, it's good to see you
getting into the game with the HDSP card. :)

 It's

I'm pretty good at learning to work with the tools
that are available--whether linux or other. Of course
there are points where that's not enough.

Sorry.  A better reference for low latency is...

  <http://www.linuxdj.com/audio/lad/resourceslatency.php3>

There are two important kernel patches: low latency, and capabilities.
You can avoid needing the capabilities patch by running as root (a
poor solution, IMHO).  But, there's no getting around needing the low
latency patch.  The stock kernels are just too badly broken from a
latency perspective for most serious audio work.


It's really not hard to build your own kernel.  But, if you don't feel
comfortable doing it, there are other options.  Planet CCRMA[1] has
properly patched kernel RPMs for most the Red Hat distributions.  They
also provide an excellent suite of audio applications.

Hi
Sorry for not posting to ardour list, but I know all of them are here too. 
I am trying to make my son use ardour for his recording and mixing. I have 
no prior experience in anything like this, I have always used ecasound for 
all my previous needs, but it may be too much for a kid.

1) Is there any walkthrough besides what is on the website.

2) I cannot record on more than 2 tracks, so what I do is start, then I 
create new session, add a mono track record it. Then I add another 
mono track and then record it. So now I have 2 tracks, once I add another 
track I cannot record the third track (the small "r" button would not 
press). Am I doing it the wrong way??

3) I am using "Ardour/GTK 0.377.1 running with libardour 0.685.0" from 
CCRMA on linux-2.4.21 with low latency patch and "jackd 0.75.0" with Alsa 
0.9.4. Is there a stability problem with this combination because after 
some use it stops working, after which it would not play or record a track 
anymore. Using scrub completely messes it up.

Regards.

Ron,
   Very well said! I pretty much completely agree with everything you
said.

<SNIP>

Yep.

Yep again.

Yep yep yep a third time. These two environments (they are really more
than apps) are worth the price of admission alone in my opinion.

Even if I never use a major Linux app, I am convinced that Linux has a
permanent place in my audio area. Jack as nothing more than an audio
router, coupled with the mixing and clock control I get from Thomas
Charbonnel's hdspmixer and hdspconf male it almost magical for me. I am
now setting up headphone mixes in Linux, controlling monitoring and how
Pro Tools sees audio sources via the routing on my HDSP 9652, and
hooking in low latency Linux soft synths all on a single machine. I
think this box completely replaces and improves upon some of the
commercially available ADAT signal routes out there at a fraction of the
cost.



Persistence is right. ;-)



Very possible technically, I suppose, but I haven't been on any of the
Ardour, Rosegarden or Jack reflectors for months so I don't know the
latest. Last thing I knew was Paul Davis saying he thought the latencies
were going to be too large. 

I personally have concerns (from a compositional standpoint) about
looping two separate big apps like these apps and getting them to really
stay in sync.

Also, for me, I sometimes need to cut audio and MIDI together as I'm
composing. I think that would be difficult to do in two apps, I while I
don't know a thing about the Jack transport efforts, I would not have
thought that cut and paste would be part of that.

I do sort of wonder when one app with decide to swallow the other? ;-)
(Or another team rise to the challenge of creating an all encompasing
app out of these two.) I guess there were technical problems as they
used different libraries for the GUI if I remember correctly.

I acknowledge that these sorts of issues are not what I'd expect a guy
running a recording studio (doing mostly audio work I presume) would
have on his wish list. My little project studio work is in a really
different space.



Well said. Wish I had as much patience. Not my strongest trait! ;-)

Rick,
   Cubase SX under Wine on Linux with the sound actually being handled
by Alsa? That would be quite an accomplishment! ;-)

   Pro Tools isn't possible as thee is no Linux driver to talk to the
hardware. From the links below it looks like no one has tried Cubase SX
yet.




The crossover stuff is pretty interesting, but I have another issue
which is physically it doesn't make sense for me to run everything I use
on the same PC. I have too many cards and too many Windows apps that are
version specific. Since I have to have multiple machine, I have no
issues with one or more of them being Windows.

Once I got my mind into this place the world got easier. I (almost)
don't care what the $$$ cost is. I just want to use the apps that are
best for me, and I'll do it in whatever native environment they were
designed for. 

For instance, I do all email on Linux, but I do almost all my multimedia
web browsing in Windows. Why? Because Linux provides natural shields
from all the email virus nonsense that's out there and none of the Linux
distributions provide a plug and play multimedia experience in either
the audio or video domains. (Windows ain't prefect either - I don't get
to play *.ogg files...) ;-)

Anyway, I don't feel that my 'freedom' is being taken away by using a
Windows app, whether it's in Windows or under Wine. It has become a
choice, and I try to use what's best and makes my life easy and
productive.

With best regards,
Mark

Hi,

 I downloaded the latest beta release of the linux kernel last night
(2.6.0-test3) but couldn't get it to compile. I looked up the error
(just using google) and I found a similar compiling problem related to
the RME Hammerfall driver that was identified (and fixed) in the 2.5
kernel series (something like the 2.5.5 kernel). It referred to a patch,
but I would think it would only work for the particular version it was
designed for.  I am trying to include the Hammerfall driver in my build,
which makes me think it may be the same problem. Has anyone been able to
compile any recent kernels w/ the Hammerfall driver?

In the likely event that no one has tried this yet, can you tell me if
it would it be better to contact the ALSA mailing list or the linux
kernel mailing list to ask for help?

1. A short summary of changes

Bugs in build process were fixed. Support for transport 
functionality in JACK 0.77.0 and newer has been added. 
Transport functions are enabeld only if Ecamegapedal is
compiled against Ecasound newer than 2.2.3. Ecamegapedal 
was verified to work if compiled against Qt-3.2.

---
2. What is Ecamegapedal?

Ecamegapedal is a real-time effect processor software with
a graphical user interface for controlling the effect 
parameters. It is meant to be used as a virtual guitar-fx 
or studio effect box. In addition to real-time operation, 
ecamegapedal also supports reading from and writing to audio 
files. All audio object and effect plugin types provided by the 
ecasound libraries are supported. This includes ALSA, JACK, 
OSS, aRts, over 20 file formats, over 30 effect types, LADSPA 
plugins and multi-operator effect presets. Ecamegapedal's 
implementation is based on ecasound and Qt libraries.

Ecamegapedal is licensed under the GPL.

The HDSP mixer (TotalMix) is an amazing little tool, allowing you to
control levels/signal path to and from any arbitrary (or all
simultaneously) inputs, outputs, etc.

But why not have this functionality for every ALSA supported card via a
JACK totalmix client based on Thomas' hdspmixer code?  

Mixer strips would represent available hardware routes by default, but
strips could be added and subtracted as new clients are started, just
like Qjackconnect but with live faders (or scopes, jellyfish etc) like
hdspmixer.  With JACK, meterbridge, and hdspmixer, aren't we most of
the way there?

This might also solve previous complaints by Mark and others (the DJ
crowd) of pops and clicks when clients connect to JACK.  Levels for
each client could simply be raised in the JACK totalmix.

Anyone working on such a thing?

Hallo,


You didn't say how old or how computer literate you kid is? I'm asking
because Ardour is a really very complex piece of software in its
*usage* patterns. I'm currently writing an article on Ardour (not in
english, though) targeted at computer users who normally don't use
pro-audio software and I find myself constantly explaining things that
just are different in Ardour compared to 'normal' applications. 

For example, 'normal' users would expect a completly other way to
opening soundfiles than how it is done in Ardour. They expect
something like "File->Open" and instead they have to create a session,
add a certain kind of Track - and avoid a Bus whatever that is - they
have to fill a soundfile db, have to convert the content of the
soundfile db to finally being able to add it to the track. And then
they cannot even just save the file, they have to *export* it. 

I understand why it is done this way in Ardour and I also understand
that Ardour isn't a *soundfile* editor, but this is just one of those
things you will have to cope with when explaining Ardour to someone
else and probably to your son. 

To make things short: maybe Audacity is a better choice here?

Hi
My son is 15 and he uses linux for everything (with my handholding, all my 
kids use it). He is a very gifted musician. I do have audacity and 
ecasound with a usable gui, but I think ardour has moch more potential 
than anything out there. I also have audio professionals that would help 
me figure it out. I usually do not let my kids touch anything that is easy 
to use (good brain excersice).

I actually have been on ardour-dev for a long time and I think it is much 
more usable than it was a couple of years ago and I should have my kids 
try to break it.

Regards

Yeah, when it comes right down to it, Audacity is a better choice most of the 
time.  I play with ardour all the time, but when I actually want to record 
something, I use audacity, because it's simple, and because it works.

I haven't thought about it much but I view the
hardware mixerstrip level fader as being synonymous
with the "trim" on a traditional mixer. If an external
device generates test tone 0db then use hardware mixer
to adjust relative hardware port to 0db.

Subsequently a DAW mixer is configured to route N
sources to the relative hardware port which is
configured to something that's thought to be 0db.
Ultimately enabling many signals of various decibal
levels to be routed through one or more hardware ports
that have constant gain.


Assuming that I'm correct about the intended purpose
of hardware mixers, then your idea mixes client routes
into a common interface with hardware ports. I'm
thinking that on a basic and simple level the problem
with this is demonstrated when you begin to use the
hardware mixer to adjust level. For example, if more
than one application routes playback to hardware
capture ports 1,2 then adjusting the hardware capture
1,2 port level will cause all application playback
sources to be adjusted. Of course that's a management
problem that a DAW mixer is designed to control.

Anyway, I just quickly read your letter and probably
missed your point entirely. Hope I didn't create extra
confusion for anyone but me--as if it's possible to
prevent myself from being confused. :)

 They used to have a section up that referred to earlier versions. I'm
 thinking they worked {tho' it's been a long time since I've visited
 that page.} which follows... that SX has a good chance. Sound Forge does
 {Tho, personally, I like snd better}

 Look how complex new versions of buzz are... it's pretty highly rated
 on the wine pages. It would be nice if we could get that community to
 join this community. It is something of the same idea.}

 What would be wrong with OSS? Have you seen the specs on
 their new drivers?


 I've not used Protools because of the hardware thing... I've messed
 around with the free version on '98... I didn't get it to do much
 other than play sounds. I didn't spend any time with it either.


 I have several machines. I have several systems in removable drive
 casings {$20-50} Switching systems is as easy as restarting. {The
 file drives are swappable as well. I don't trust security on any
 system. {Especially seeing as I know next to nothing about it.
 {And really don't want to waste the time learning}}}



 {You can}


 For me the system, especially linux, is a growing thing. Linux needs
 to be worked into... configured and scripted as one goes. It take a
 lot of setup but, hopefully, when you're done you've got a highly
 individual system that matches your needs and requirements specifically.}

 {"Out of the box" just don't get it.}

 You can do the same with win or mac but... that's where you're limited.
 With linux you got virtually no limits... with commercial systems you're
 tied in to that system.

 Look at how much simpler a quick batch file or shell script can make
 your life... multiply that times hundreds and you start getting a working
 system.

Hi, 
I am interested in using a USB soundcard for my laptop (gentoo!) so that I can record a standard analog stereo line signal (red & white rca connectors would do) I don't need line outs or digital, although they could possibly come in handy some day as well ;)

Any suggestions are appreciated, thanks!

Robert Brown



-->><<--__-->><<--
Sorry about that.  I did not realize that the organ stuff was not on
that page. I was confused.

Jeremiah




-->><<--__-->><<--

Personally, I like the idea, but it doesn't give the exact same
functionality. In the RME card I can route ADAT In 1 to ADAT Out 22 and
I have no appreciable latency. I could do the same thing in your model
going through a Jack mixer, an idea I find quite attractive, but in come
cases it wouldn't be as good, really.

None the less, someone should consider the concept and see if they want
to do it because I think the vast majority of applications would be fine
with the latency.


Absolutely. The only thing missing is the GUI, which Thomas has done,
and the ability to scale volumes to do the faders.

These faders could also be automated pretty easily, I think, which could
have lots of applications.

One last idea, allow me to choose which Jack channels have dither
applied and then even dithering in Jack could make sense to me.

The first step towards automation... ;-)





-->><<--__-->><<--

I like my Roland/Edirol UA-30.  It has "just worked" whenever I've plugged it 
into a Linux box running a 2.4 kernel.  It does also have digital in/out 
which I don't use either, but I haven't seen an analog only one for much 
cheaper.  It has a crude level meter and a level slider.

Rob




-->><<--__-->><<--

Yes. jackEQ is basically this app.

I committed changes today (with help from Steve) which give all the 
meters a gain slider. I have also added a monitor and master channel.

The next two major steps are allowing multiple channels and the freq 
tweak style jack connections.

ie. an option menu where shift+click or ctrl+click will select multiple 
jack i/os.

If you haven't done it yet, using a ram drive for jack's temp dir helps =
take some of the load of your hard drive. Things like asio mode and =
hardware monitoring/metering (when supported) also help.

Subject:	[linux-audio-user] how to invest sensible to get more stability =
for JACK
Hello,
i am working quite intense on lerning ARDOUR by doing. Using its beta i
exrerience some bugs that are more or less tolerablein such great an App
for no cost (crashes when trying some adventurous routing-stuff, some
lesser gui-issues).
After all there are only 2 really serious problems:

1.)Importing .wav-files fails too often (regardless if these files are
written by Samplitude, Audacity, rezound or even Ardour itself)

How is that on your setups out there?

2.)Many xruns, (some after 2 seconds, others after 2 mins, mostly within
40 secs or so - sometimes i had testrecordings of unbroken 10 minutes)

I use Ardour on SuSE 8.2 pro with jack0.74 as root only on runlevel 3 in
Windowmaker, all networking is off, no kdeinit is running.

System is:
Athlon XP 1800, 512MB DDR, 60GB Samsung HD/IDE, Terratec EWX 24/96=20

I think about
 wether i buy another IDE-HD and spread the installation on 2 disks to
get more bandwith=20
 or getting another 512 RAM to let Jack run without HD
 or investing in a SCSI-HD for installation and Projects and using the
IDE-Disk for Archiving only.

What would you prefer, how are your Experiences about this
Bandwithissues?

Thank you





-->><<--__-->><<--

This is the most sensible option IMO.

You will always get xruns if you are recording to the same drive as your 
  OS. Even the same ide cable can cause problems. It's best to have two 
disks hda (OS) and hdc (recording).

IDE disks are much larger and cheaper than scsi and these days can 
handle all the bandwidth for serious multitrack recording.

Hallo,


Okay, then give him Ardour. It may be complicated but I find it very

15-year old, IMO.

Its not neccesary though - I only got one IDE disk, with a plan to get
another later, but I've not had problems so far (recording 8 or 10 tracks
in ardour simultaneously).

I probably will add one at some point, maybe external firewire, for the
ability to move it about. But if you only use a few tracks it doesn't
seem to be vital like it used to be.

OT: If your using modern SCSI disks it can pay to turn down the disk
elevator size with elvtune - otherwise the disks elevtator fights with
the kernels and it can effect your throughput quite badly.

- Steve



-->><<--__-->><<--

I strongly suggest you start with Audacity 1.0, then move to Audacity 
1.2.0 when it comes out. It's a far better program for beginners - 
I've found even people with no computer experience at all can start 
using it quickly.

Cheers

Daniel



-->><<--__-->><<--

This may be true, but at the moment it's mostly potentially rather 
than actually useful for the new user. Audacity is deep once you get 
into it, too - especially version 1.2.0-pre1. It works on both 
levels.


They probably won't be able to give you much help with Ardour, unless 
they've been using it already.


That's perverse - the brain excersize should be in making the music, 
not the basic operation of the tools!
 
Cheers

Daniel



-->><<--__-->><<--

Other software seems to manage recording a reasonable number of tracks 
with just one disk in total though.

Surely in an ideal world, the OS would not be performing disk writes 
during recording?

Hello,

In the course of researching another Linux article for Sound on Sound, 
I was having a discussion with the features editor about latency, 
specifically Linux versus Windows and Mac. The only cross-platform 
serious study I'm aware of is this one, which is a bit out of date:

http://gigue.peabody.jhu.edu/~mdboom/latency-icmc2001.pdf

Now the features editor looked it up for himself and found this page, 
also out of date I think:

http://www.rme-audio.com/english/linux/alsa.htm

It quotes a latency under Linux for the Hammerfall of 20ms, where as 
Windows can do 6ms with this card if you install the ASIO drivers. I 
think he's now sceptical that Linux can compete with Windows/ASIO in 
the area of low latency.

Can any RME (or other pro card) users on the list quote reliable 
latency figures for their own systems? It would be very helpful.

My personal experience is that you can get negligible latency on 
Audacity overdubs with Mandrake and the 'multimedia' kernel, compared 
to obvious latency on Windows 98. But I haven't set up any scientific 
tests with matching hardware.

Cheers

Daniel

I agree completely. Audacity or Rezound would be much better choices until
the system is well understood.

I found this interesting and maybe topical. Last night I built the latest
Ardour from a Gentoo ebuild. Turns out it's the only Jack program I've found
so far that requires me to be logged in as root to connect to the Jack
server. All the others (admittedly not that many) allow me to connect as a
user.

Assuming this is not just something strange about my setup, do you really
want a new user logged on as root learning Ardour? I wouldn't...

Just a thought.

- Mark





-->><<--__-->><<--

Daniel,
   I'm an RME user. My experience is that Windows and Linux are identical.
When using Jack I can set my RME cards up for the same latency values
(I.e. - buffer sizes) as I can in Windows. This should yield the same
latency I think.

   Do we have any tools that will actually test latency? For instance, I
suppose I could send a signal output of an ADAT port and record it coming
back in on another ADAT port and measure by hand, but that's sort of labor
intensive. Any other ideas? I'd be happy to take some measurements if we
have an agreed upon method for doing it.

On Debian, though.

Hi Taybin,
   Sure, under RH9/PlanetCCRMA it's the same for me I'm sure. (I haven't
used Ardour on that box of mine as it's too slow for that sort of thing.)
That wasn't my point at all. Under Gentoo I haven't built in capabilities as
I'm waiting for the new HDSP 9652 driver to get into CVS. Then I'll be able
to rebuild Alsa without bothering Thomas.

   However, I'd agree with what I think your point is if I wanted real-time
scheduling, but I didn't. I started Jack running normal scheduling as a
normal user. All my other Jack applications have no problems connecting to
the Jack server. Ardour said it couldn't connect to Jack. It was the only
app that did this so far. Maybe Ardour cannot connect without real-time
scheduling enabled? This didn't used to be the case, but possibly it is
today? I don't know.

   Please understand I'm not asking you or Paul to change or fix anything. I
don't care which way Ardour works. It's completely immaterial to me. My
point was that if this father is going to turn his kid loose on his system
learning Linux and Ardour, apparently on some distributions you have to be
root to even start Ardour and that raises other risks that he might not want
to take. (rm / ?) I know you don't do things like that, but my 11 year old
kid does, so I'd never let him touch Ardour running as root on one of my
systems.

   Longer term maybe more distributions with have the capabilities thing
enabled out of the box, but I've been told there are good reasons not to do
that so I wouldn't guess when it will happen.

Mark





-->><<--__-->><<--


Frank,
   I'll look up the ebuild maintainer for Ardour and probably just file a
bug report on Bugzilla.

Thanks,
Mark

Heh torben, what's the issue with jack-start? Is this only for
media-sound/j-a-c-k
or media-sound/jack-cvs, too?

jack-cvs seems to be building fine. Let me know.

------- Additional Comment #6 From J. Ellis 2003-05-29 09:05 EST -------
I'm not going to put the capabilities stuff back right now. The idea of
having to
hack kernel include files to get it to work seems 'distasteful'. I can only
imagine
the bug reports...
<SNIP>

   I will still enter a request, but it looks like this is considered at
least controversial by some at Gentoo.

   Is there any reason that the ebuild could not patch the kernel include
file to add capabilities? It's like a two line change, isn't it?

Cheers,
Mark





-->><<--__-->><<--

As my machine is dual boot and Audacity runs on Windows, it would be nice to
just use Audacity to make some measurements in both environments as that
would be a very direct comparison. Unfortunately the Windows environment is
Win ME, so I think this limitation would raise objections from folks who
want to favor Windows. They'll say we should test XP.

I should have mentioned that with a PlanetCCRMA low-latency kernel on a
previous machine I was able to run an RME card consistently at approximately
2mS latency without xruns using Jack, where as the same machine running Win
ME had to run at least 12mS to not have noticeable clicks and pops.

- Mark





-->><<--__-->><<--
I know what you meen, one of my 13yr can kill the most stable system by 
just sitting at the keyboard (no kidding). But if I remeber correctly I 
could use ardour as the user that starts jack from about a year ago. I did 
not try it this time since I did not mess with capabilities





-->><<--__-->><<--
And you still can if you are on the RH/PlanetCCRMA flow. Using vanilla
Gentoo I am not able to.






-->><<--__-->><<--

Ok then I take it back. You can achieve multi track recording for a few 
tracks (< 10) with a single IDE. Go for more RAM.

But if you want to take advantage of Jack then you will be doing more 
than 10 tracks pretty quickly.

Although I'm not suggesting we all start taking advantage of Jack.

Hallo,


Just including jackstart seems very sensible. The Debian package
includes jackstart and has instructions on how to patch the kernel for
capabilities.  But if a user is running a stock kernel, jackstart will not work, and one is forced to use jackd. This is absoluetly okay, IMO.

The alternative would be to build a kernel-image, on that jackstart
depends, which just will not work out in the end. It's better to just
leave that in the users' responsibiliy.

It's a different model. I'm an "audio professional" in the television and
radio industry and I use Linux exclusively for anything that doesn't
depend on Windows drivers (i.e. mpeg-2 boards, closed caption boxes, etc,
etc). I also contribute to development of free and open audio software,
mostly in the internet radio direction. I've found there's less
product-centric focus and more creativity and support for degugging and
innovation.

I'm running KDE under Gentoo and I've only had problems with one program
and jack xruns: Swami and FluidSynth running a 119MB drum set patch. It
began to produce so many xruns I could hit a crash cymbal without
droupouts. But whatever, the developers say it's beta software. On the
other hand I've run Rosegarden triggering Hydrogen, Zynaddsubfx and a MIDI
synth with no droupouts and came up with a good tune, recorded it in
Audacity. So it's workig out well. Swami and fluidsynth will be grand in
due time...

Also, I'm using jacko.py, a python script that gives a nice GUI to the
jack server. It's been great, along with QTjackconnect and ALSA patch bay.
This whole collection of windows take up a desktop, so I'm thinking of
trying to put them into one interface...like a "start audio system" GUI.

The BBC trialled Ogg Vorbis/Icecast streaming but last thing I heard 
was that they weren't making it a permanent service yet. That means 
at the moment you've got to use RealPlayer, which I think 
intentionally disables streaming to hard disc in a feeble attempt at 
DRM. I guess you could intercept the audio on its way to the 
soundcard somehow. 

If you just want to test the software, try Virgin Radio which has a 
permanent high-quality Icecast service. If it's Radio 1 you're after 
specifically, you'll probably get better quality results using a good 
FM tuner connected to your soundcard, or maybe via a digital 
satellite TV service if you're not in the UK.

I have a pretty fast IP over satellite broadband system which is good 
for 400-450kb on a typical connection, but I still get skips and 
breaks in the audio with RealPlayer - I don't with Icecast.

That reminds me of a discussion I was having with our guitarist on 
Tuesday. He said he needed 24 tracks for his solo project, so he'd 
have to hire a bigger studio because our desk is only 8 buss. I said 
if four tracks was enough for the Beatles and eight tracks enough for 
Pink Floyd, then eight inputs on the Delta 1010 would be enough for 
him. I could tell he wasn't impressed by that.

One of the things that really dismays me about some people who want to 
record music is that they think you need a lot of equipment to get 
started. Like 24 inputs, or a minimum of 6 mics on a drumkit. I've 
seen some people spend all their money on a ton of kit, and then fail 
to record even one complete song. Having taken delivery of all the 
equipment and put it all together, they are faced with a creative 
brick wall when they don't know where to start.

A friend of mine bought a big 16 channel Soundcraft desk to mix from 
her keyboard and drum machine. Someone had told her that was the one 
she needed. I helped her set it up, but I think she just took one 
look at the about 200 knobs and faders and her heart was no longer in 
the project. We set up Cubase to control the keyboard, and created a 
drum and bass track. It didn't sound 'professional' like she expected 
it would with all the professional equipment around her, and I don't 
think she ever used any of it again.
   
Cheers

Hello,

now that DVD recorders become affordable DVD audio might be an interesting
alternative to audio CDs. I always feel a bit unhappy when I have to
convert my 24/96 files down to 16/44.1. Is there any DVD audio authoring
tool for Linux ? Are there any patent issues connected with DVD PCM audio ?
And is there a software DVD audio player for Linux ?

Hi Lee:

  A brief HOWTO describing how you do that (WINE version, Buzz version,
etc.) would be most welcome. I've tried to make it happen a few times
but didn't get very far.

There is a Yamaha standalone pro DVD recorder which is Linux based. It 
has XLR audio inputs. I assume it can do DVD Audio and SACD as well 
as your regular DVD video - if not, it might be just a question of a 
firmware upgrade.


Presumably you could save something like a .wav in 24/96 and then 
distribute it on a data medium?

Hi everyone,

I was setting up the main music machine here to run RedHat 9.0, so that I could use the Planet CCRMA colection when I ran into a little problem.  I thought that I would post it here, so that it might get archived for future reference.

I had some problems with the driver for the older Motu mtpav midi router we have that's driven by the computer via the printer port.

It turns out that the CUPS printing system, which is the rh9.0 default, totally ties up the parallel port even when the defined printer is a network printer.  Once "cups" is loaded the port becomes unusable even if the cups service is later stopped.  The only way to free up the port is to reboot the machine it seems.

Using the old style LPD printing seems to work just fine, so the problem is easily fixed.

Machine is older PIII running the planet 2.4.21-1.ll.acpi kernel with acpi turned off on the kernel command line.  LowLatencey is turned on via /etc/sysctl.conf.  Alsa drivers seem to be version 0.9.4 or newer(whatever Nando compiled on the above kernel).  Card 0 = snd-ice1712   Card 1 = snd-mtpav

Hmmm, not necessarily the most tactful answer.  Most people don't 
understand the recording process.  Rarely do you have enough things
going on at once to need all 24 tracks going at once; the magic happens
in the multitracking, and using ardour (for example) gives you
virtually unlimited tracks.  That's a far cry from the Sgt Pepper
days where you had 4 tracks total to record on, period.  An explanation
of that might have gotten you the job.


A good musician sounds good even on bad or minimal gear; no amount of
good gear will make a bad musician sound good.

The learning curve on a lot of this stuff is steep.  Your friend would
have been better off with something like a small Behringer mixer and a
Delta 44 card to handle her stuff.  Maybe if you offer to set her up
with a usable system, you can get a deal on her Soundcraft desk!!

Hi Daniel,

Friday 22 August 2003 11:13 skrev Daniel James:

I feel I have to try and clear up somethings, I think there may be some miss 
understandings here about what a input and what a track is.

-
In a digital world there is a big difference between the number of external 
inputs/outputs you have and the number of internal tracks you utilize.

Many external inputs are mainly needed if you _need_ to record many sources at 
the same time, ANALOG sources.
Like if you are recording a symphony orchestra you may wish to use lots of 
inputs to capture a room fully. 
If you record a 4-piece rock band - live - and wish to have great control of 
the result, you probably need between 8-16 inputs. If you don't record live, 
but rather take it one step at the time you need nowhere near that amount of 
inputs.

Another reason for having lots of inputs (and outputs) is that you may have 
external effects that you wish to route the signal through. This is quickly 
going out of fashion, atleast in my world, hobby musican. I work entirely 
inside the computer once I got the analog sources recorded.

--

Internal tracks on the other hand exist only inside the computer, normally you 
mix these inside the computer before sending it to a output (e.g. monitors). 

These can normally be created and utilized almost unlimitedly. It is true you 
can't record an unlimited amount of channels, but the limits are normally not 
a problem.
Of the top of my head I'd say that 100 playback tracks should NOT be a 
problem. (_Should_ not be a problem, I imagine few people are trying the 
limits right now in Linux audio, programs are probably not fully optimized 
yet)
Working in a computer you are not bound to a physical number of tracks that 
you must "fit" your music in. Rather you would probably start creating tracks 
as needed, group them as needed. 
Later in the composition if you for instance needed to add a distorted Oboe to 
get those wierd tones that define your speed metal recording, you would not 
reuse a track that wasn't utilized at that point. Rather you would create a 
NEW track to keep the composition well structured.
(reusing tracks is probably not applicable to pro recordings, I imagine they 
would NEVER reuse tracks, when there are no more left, there are no more 
left. In a home-recording situation, e.g. 4-track or 8-track it is quite 
common to reuse tracks though.)

Conclusion: in a fully digital recording studio there are no real limits to 
the number of tracks you can utilize. You tend to use MORE tracks than in an 
similar analog situation. Just because you are allowed to structure things 
much better. This provides a much better basis for realizing your 
compositions, you have less constraints to take into account.

The number of external inputs and outputs you need is defined by the number of 
concurrent audio sources you wish to record/listen to. If you record step by 
step and use artificial drums, like me, you don't need more than say 4 inputs 
and 2 outputs. The more advanced you get you probably need more inputs and 
outputs, but very few people need 24 inputs in a digital studio.

/Robert

ps. I really don't know these things, I just pretend I do. ds.





-->><<--__-->><<--

I was referencing Jack because once you start using it as it is intended 
to be used you will be working with more than 10 tracks at one time. 
You may only be recording one track but you could be streaming 20 to get 
that one track sounding right.

In that case a lot of RAM is very important so you don't fill up the tmp 
dir constantly and two HDDs will make the whole process more likely to 
succeed.

Hi,

As an additional note to my previous email, I've also managed to get my 
internal modem working too!

I was wondering what I should do next regarding configuring the PC for music.

My initial thoughts are:

1. MIDI Interface
2. Low Latency Kernel
3. ALSA/DSP24Value card
4. Software: Rosegarden, Audacity, Ardour, etc.

Any suggestions would be much appreciated.

This is exactly what I have suggested yesterday and today. Gentoo does this
other places, like with 3D acceleration. They provide ebuild that don't work
until I compile my kernel to turn on certain things and edit my XF86config

We'll see. I think we'll get there.

A while back some of the kernel developers were a bit shocked we were using

Hi
As everyone recommended, I am getting my son to use audacity, but now we 
are having  a probolem where secind track becomes very noisy after 
recording.

The first track records fine but when the second track is recorded it is 
very noisy, and even seems to have a pitch shift. When I tried to figure 
out what is going on I found out thet the first track is bleeding through 
to the second track. So even if I mute the second track when I record the 
second track I see the first track bleeding through and see the waveform 
on the second track. Please keep in mind that the input is a guitar pickup 
not a mic so there should not be any crosstalk between tracks.


I am using SB live with alsa-0.9.4 linux-2.4.21 (lowlat) audacity-1.1.3-1. 
Anyone seen this before??
Regards





-->><<--__-->><<--

I think this is a known bug in the unstable versions. Set the number 
of tracks to record to 2 instead of 1 and it should be fine. If you 
don't use the second track (ie not stereo or 2 panned instruments) 
you can easily delete it with the cross on the individual track 
panel.

Cheers

-->><<--__-->><<--

Taybin,
   I wish I could, but thinking that it would likely be of little interest
to me I tuned out pretty quickly. There wasn't a lot of discussion as I
remember it. A number of people were using generic words like 'dangerous' or
'stupid', but frankly it didn't matter to me as this is the only game in
town. What choice do I have anyway?

   There was no additional concern about actually running apps like Ardour
or Rosegarden as root vs. using capabilities. They hated that sort of answer
also. It was really that they didn't think any of this should run as root.

TO BE CLEAR - I have no issue with this one way or the other. I understand
I'm taking my chances. I'm OK with that. I will say that the other day I
quickly tried Rosegarden with Jack and as soon as I connected an audio track
in Rosegarden to a 'Jack Audio' stream the machine was locked up hard and
nothing but a hard reset would bring it back. THERE ARE RISKS. (My apologies
to Guillaume, Chris or Rich for bring that up here before signing up for
their lists again.)

   If I had to venture a guess it was probably more that some 'intentionally
bad' application could be written to take advantage of a machine that had a
kernel patched for capabilities, and not specifically that jackstart itself
was a problem. I would suspect that a number of developers would not be
particularly concerned with this, but I'll make the observation that I
quickly counted more than 40 Jack applications on the web site this morning.
What percentage of those have actually been tested using a capabilities
based kernel, and what assurance does a user like me have that one of them
doesn't do an rm / intentionally or by mistake? As this list grows to 100 or
200 apps, how will I - as a user, not a developer - be protected against
something like this?

   Please remember, that's just my guess and does not represent anyone's
true reasons.

I think the only risk (that I know off) would be an application that
hangs the machine because there is an infinite loop or lockup in the
audio thread (which is the one that runs with SCHED_FIFO - realtime
schedulling). The capabilities granted by jackstart to jackd (thus to
the jack clients) do not allow the process access to arbitrary files. 

Obviously that can happen if you are just running applications as root
and not using capabilities at all (all bets are off if you run as root).

Jack has a watchdog timer that supposedly would kill apps that do that.
It does not always work. When I was having problems with deadlocks in
2.4.20 (traced by Andrew Morton to a bug in the ext3 code) the internal
Jack watchdog process did not kill jack or the offending process. I used
another program (rt_monitor) to do that, and it was pretty effective in
reviving the machine after each lockup. 


Not that many choices (against badly behaving jack clients). Watchdog
timers that look for errant processes would be the first. But the _real_
protection should come from a better scheduler that takes that into
account in the kernel itself (I saw messages in a list, can't remember
which, and a patch for such a scheduler).

I have just installed the Planet on my linux partition and have started in to reading the jack and alsa user documentation.  

I want to do some basic composition and aranging in midi.  I was thinking that I would use MusE with Fluidsynth and various soundfonts.  At this point I am not trying to input any external signals from guitars, hardware synths, mics, etc.

I noticed that MusE gives an option to use Alsa only or to use Jack (which I assume would be in combination with Alsa as a driver).  Any opinions whether it is worth going to the trouble of learning to use jack with MusE to import, modify, create and playback midi tracks? 

Thanks,

Barton,
   First, jack is very easy to use from a user's point of view, so that
should not be a problem if you find you need it.

   Frankly, for what you are suggesting you want to start out doing (just
FluidSynth) I would not bother with Jack immediately, but if you find
yourself needing more than one soft synth, then using Jack is a very easy
way to do it.

Cheers,
Mark

Fernando,
   Thanks for the info. It's interesting.

   In the text below, please remember I have no position on this. I'm just
asking some questions, not interrogating!

Mark


Is this true for all applications running on a capabilities enabled kernel,
or just those that are granted capabilities by jackstart?

Is the concern clear? Could a particularly nasty person create a program
replace some file used by jackstart of a Jackified application, that could
open up the permissions you've granted?

On this kernel could that nasty person create a program that exploits these
capabilities in ways beyond what you are granting?

I think this is the general concern, as I have understood it.


Certainly


Maybe it's of no concern. I don't know. I think one of the advertised
advantages of Linux is its security. However, one of the weaknesses is that
people download source, of which they have no real knowledge, build and
install as root, and then try out. PlanetCCRMA really reduces this weakness
as we get precompiled binaries with folks like you to help protect us.
However, if some nasty person out there wants to exploit this potential
weakness then they could cause problems for people getting source from the
net, and I think the 'capabilities enabled kernel' *may* make these
weaknesses greater??

I must admit, that there is some truth in that.
At the other hand: the Opportunity of using virtually as much tracks as

I recorded an Album with my former Band on a Fostex 12-Track Tapemachine
and wanted just one Song to be stuffed with dubbed Gits, VoiceFX and
some Extrapercussion. We stopped the Project because to bounce all the
tracks to allow us to do more Overdubs took so much Time that we would
have need twice the Budget we had for the entire Album to do just one
Song.
(In the End we just "polished" a Demo of that Track that i recorded at

-->><<--__-->><<--

Could you please turn OFF that SPOTLIGHT!! :-)


That is true of any app that uses SCHED_FIFO scheduling, regardless of
how they switch into SCHED_FIFO (and regardless of which kernel they are
running on). 

In the case of jack and a capabilities enabled kernel, provided you do
not run apps as root, applications granted special capabilities through
jackstart will be able to wedge the machine if improperly programmed.
Other applications will not receive any special capabilities and will
not be able to wedge the machine. 


Meaning grant more capabilities than just "allow you to switch into
SCHED_FIFO"? Yes, of course. A "hacked" jackstart/jack would be able to
do that. You could give jack clients any capabilities you wanted. But of
course any program that is hacked can be made into an evil program :-) A
hacked jack _client_ would not be able to receive any more than what
jackstart/jackd gives. 


Meaning a clever programmer just creating a jack client? No, I don't
think so (but what do I know?). As long as jack is not changed then it
will just give a given set of capabilities, a client can only receive or
get what is given. 

But jackstart does not have a monopoly on using capabilities. Any
program can use them in a capabilities enabled kernel. But to "exploit"
capabilities you have to initially be root (jackstart is suid root for
that reason). But, if you are root somehow and want to do nasty things,
you don't really need capabilities at all.


Yup. Any time you do something as root you are vulnerable. 


Yes and no. While I take care with what I build there are no guarantees.
In that sense I'm not that different from a "regular" user, obviously it
would be impossible for me to security audit all software...


Not really. If some nasty person wants to create problems it does not
need to use capabilities. The very fact that normally users build
software as root is more than enough (ie: create a software project with
a fancy name, make users install it as root and in the process create a
back door for latter hacking). Ugly and simple.

 It seems to me that the process should leave some mark... should be evidenced
 somehow. A bit of minimalism {tho' 30 tracks hardly seems minimal to me} might
 reference the source and in so doing help define "a" linux {digital} sound. 
 Methods by which folk deal with the issue serve to develop that a bit further,
 push the medium, yadda, yadda... {Moog has a unique sound that many folk find
 to be appealing simply because it's a Moog sound, Some of the appeal to early
 punk is the lofi sound, Most old jazz/blues studios have a particular flavor
 to their recordings, etc...}

 I like computer music though... I'm not interested in processing a pre-existant
 sound or trying to give a customer anything specific. I can afford to let the
 sound get "coloured" by the process. {In fact... that's desirable.}




-->><<--__-->><<--




 I usually keep binaries {debs} and config files {sources list pointed at
 the second partition... most of the /etc directory} on a second partition.
 {I use cfdisk to format things... I've not yet had it eat a partition
 other than the one I'm targeting.} I generally copy the home directory
 and whatever other stuff I've changed there as well. {you can automate this}

 After the intial install and configuration all you had to do to reinstall
 to a pristine state is boot the {there's a really small Debian install 
 distribution that seems almost failsafe to me {installs on anything}} 
 install disk, run the install and after the restart, when the installer
 runs dselect. you can log in on a second terminal, cp the appropriate
 files and just run dselect from there. Takes an hour or so at the outside
 {depending on what you have installed ...keep specific debs {just copy
 the /var/cache/apt/archives directory to a directory after you do an 
 online install} and you can just select everything in dselect}.

 You can afford to take a few risks this way. {Which I do all too often}
 
 It also helps to recreate the install on a second disk or partition {8o gig
 disks are ~100.oo ...an install only takes a few gigs.} ...You can put all
 of the relevant systems into lilo {Debians install will do this automatically}
 and just boot another system should you happen to munge things.

 If you use pluggable drives you can set up specific system environments for
 specific uses {only need the first few gigs on the drive} ...Linux {unlike
 windows} travels really well. You can generally switch drives between systems.
 If you save a copy of the config files on a partition it becomes a simple
 matter to move a system between machines.

Hi

I'm trying to get *any* input/output (MIDIin/audio out) going with
smurf, but didn't succed so far. Is there any trick that one should know
of? I don't need anything fancy, simply to be able to press a note on my
Evolution keyboard and hear the sound comming from smurf as I edit. My
soundcard is set up with ALSA + OSS emulation and works with other apps.

I do realize that smurf is so old it's dead. What are other, more recent
applications for editing soundfonts? 
I'm on debian/unstable...

Thanks in advance for any advice.

Smurf is now called Swami. I didn't use it, but AFAIK it now uses the

I'm making copies of a sound file and I want to confirm by sight and sound
that the original and the copy are bit-for-bit accurate.

Are there any Linux audio applications that would allow me to invert a WAV
file and sum it (mix it) with another file and then display the resulting
waveform?  If they're identical I'd get a flat line (the two would sum to
silence); if not I'd hear see and hear noise.  With a graphic display I'd
also be able to see if there are any patterns to the errors.

Thanks!

hello friends,

i'm searching for a card with just digital i/o to connect to an external
converter. budget is critical. one possibility we've thought of is the
dio2448, but i've seen also the edirol UA-1D USB:

http://www.edirol.com/products/info/ua1d.html

i couldn't find it in the list supported by alsa, but perhaps it's because
it's still new. any comments on this? any other suggestion in that price
range?

thank you.

Under Windows, I use Wavelab or Cool Edit to trim the initial silence so
that the starting samples in the two files line up.

This morning I'm trying to do the same with Audacity.


Len Moskowitz




-->><<--__-->><<--

Len,
   Yes. I do the same thing by hand with Sound Forge, but that's not
automatic. For instance, I start recording on one machine before I start
playing on the first machine, so I get an unknown amount of opening
silence on the second recording. I'll be sending from one machine to the
other over ADAT, so I expect that the digital data will be identical,
but not time aligned.

   I was looking for a solution that was possibly more like 'diff',
where it finds where the differences begin in two text files even if the
line numbers are different. When I read through the rsync description I
didn't see that it would do that, but possibly it does.

Thanks,
Mark

Luis,
   I can highly recommend the Hammerfall Light. (Digi9636) I found one
on Ebay this morning. They are a bit expensive, but the driver under
Alsa is quite good from what I Can tell. I use it in one of my machines.

http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=2551817746&category=41787

You wouldn't face many issues in terms of Alsa support vs. other
solutions that are not as tested.

This script turnes a pair of wav files into a pair of text files with one
sample per line and diffs them, it is pretty simple and did the job, but
its not very efficient. I used it to check dodgy spdif cables :)

run it with eg. "./audio-diff file1.wav file2.au"
it doesnt like float wav files though, cos it uses sox.

audio-diff:
-- cut --
#!
sox $1 /tmp/$$-a.dat
sox $2 /tmp/$$-b.dat
diff /tmp/$$-a.dat /tmp/$$-b.dat
rm -f /tmp/$$-a.dat /tmp/$$-b.dat

Steve,
   The beauty of the Linux command line! I love it!

   Presumably if one file had a few seconds of silence at the start of
end I could just delete that by hand in vi? I don't know how far off in
lines diff can handle looking for a first match, but a few seconds could
end up being 100K lines...

Thanks,

How about using dd?  You could set the block size ("bs=") based on the
sample size and rate and "seek=" past the silence.

Gang,

I'm not sure this is the best place to ask this, but here goes . . .

I have a "VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C686 AC97 Audio Controller (rev 80)."
according to /proc/pci using the via82cxxx_audio module that comes stock
with Red Hat 9. (The 2.4.20-8 version due to some buggyness in the
2.4.20-20.9 versions V4L drivers.)

I also have a "Burr-Brown Japan PCM2702" (according to
/proc/bus/usb/devices) sound device built into my home stereo receiver. 
It seems to use a driver simply called "audio" that is part of the USB
driver set.

I want to use the VT82cxxx for everything except a fixed set of multimedia
apps (xawtv/motv, mplayer, xine, xmms).

My first problem is that the USB device seems to be /dev/dsp and the sound
card (actually on board audio) is /dev/dsp1.  I'd like this to be the
other way around.  There is no entry in /etc/modules.conf for the USB
device . . . my first instinct was to just switch them around there.

The other thing is that control over which device gets used seem to be
flakey.  For instance the motv -C switch seems to do nothing.  I always
get the output from the soundcard.  With mplayer using -ao oss:/dev/dsp[1]
seems to give me control over which device is used about 90% of the time. 
The other 10% it just seems to "do what it wants to."  I'm about as sure
as I can be that this isn't just fat-finger syndrome.

Thanks in advance for any and all advice.

-Peter

PS: I suspect someone will suggest "Just use Alsa." but there doesn't seem
to be an Alsa driver for the USB device.

-P

PPS: Anyone know of any good "CD Player" app that supports CDDA?  I'd like
to be able to use my CDROM->USB->Home Stereo.





-->><<--__-->><<--

no info on their site, but a quick google indicates that
the output is resampled, negating quality usage.

the cmi8738 chipset in the dio2448 works well (i have several).
The midiman seems a bit overpriced (~e120) as there are complete motherboards
containing this chipset for less than the price of the midiman:-)
Having said that, i havnt personally found a cheaper card. If you
find something, pls let us know:-)

I never get sick of embarassing myself. So here I go again :-). Maybe
the problem is that I'm a "right brain" and that is why I've spent
4 years building my recording studio using Linux (never owned a Window
Box in My life). But after endless hardware test, software test, reading
about latency issues, a week of hdparm tests, IRQ tests, articles 
comparing one file system performance over another, testing this peice 
of software, that peice of software, along with the many other computer 
tasks that one needs to do (it goes on and on)... I have settled on 
Muse, ecasound/tkeca, Timidity and no Jack (for now, but this list is 
educating Me for the future Jack use).

Please let Me know if I'm on the mark or not. With Muse's capability to 
record/play/sync _both_ WAV _and_ midi (in both directions), combined 
with being able to connect with many synth sources (without Jack), use 
LADSPA plugins, what would the other advantages be to using Jack in this 
situation?

I _just_ settled on these combinations after 4 years of only producing 
"test peices" of music. And the latest distraction was the xrun and 
latency problems that I was having with Jack. I was running as root 
exclusivly during all this also (just to eliminate as many variables as 
possible). I'm sure I would uncover all the problems I've encountered 
_eventually_. But I just need to create some music.

The ecasound/tkeca/Timidity/Muse combination seems to solve the midi/WAV 
sync problems (and I don't even have the version of Muse that _records_ 
a WAV, it only _plays_ a WAV), and yet I've managed to rec/play/sync 
midi or wav together in any combination. There appears to be (so far) 
many ways to accompish any recording task I need with this combination 
of software. I have, although, only just started with this direction and 
just joined both the Timidity and Muse mailing list _today_ (been on 
ecasound list for a while), so more will be revealed.

Please forgive my long, rambling email. I've been working on solutions 
for a long time and have wanted to post something about all this. I 
think it's also complicated by the fact that I'm always writing scripts 
or hacking some file to make everything work as hastle free as possible. 
If I was just concerned with Myself, then it would be much easier 
because I'm comfortable with (for instance) ecasound command line only. 
I just want to build things that are easy for my other "left brained" 
musician friends to use. I just may go (eventually) with "Planet". But 
I've already invested so much time with SuSE that it would mean learning 
another distrob. But the idea of eliminating the compiling problems is 
enough of a reason to do it. And it sounds like they keep things up to date.

I will say one last thing and then I will shut up. After all the time 
trying to figure out all the xruns and latency problems, I finally 
mounted /tmp in ram and now Move all my files there and do all my 
multitracking/effect processing/midi recording combinations right out of 
there. So far so good, but I've only recorded one (WAV) track and 
multiple midi tracks (with effects). But there's no latency or xruns 
problems. With Jack, there was no tweeking that would get rid of the 
latency or xruns. There's not an ounce of latency problems with that 
aformented set up. Let's see what happens when I have many tracks of 
WAVS, midi, and effects playing/recording at the same time. If I start 
getting xruns, I will probly go out and buy some Fostex "all in one" 
unit and use my Computer to just chat with Women online. :-)

Again, my appoligies for the long email... Rocco




-->><<--__-->><<--


I'm currently using a similar but different setup:
Muse, fluidsynth, audacity, no jack

Works like a charm whenever I can get audacity to cooperate with my Quattro.

Timidity is nice for rendering MIDI, but I've found it to have too much 
latency for live softsynth use.

Check the ALSA soundcard matrix. Any card that has a MIDI interface and
also is on the ALSA list will work. I have an M-Audio Delta 1010LT and it
works fine.


I believe the CCRMA distro takes care of this, no?


<opinion>
Ardour does not work and play well with others. I don't keep up
with CVS but the beta2 version I have isn't very flexable. Granted, it's a
good DAW but it doesn't work with MIDI too well, so you can pretty much
rule out using soft synths in any sort of sync. It's also supposed to send
MTC for possible sync to other apps. I cannot get this to work at all, in
fact, I can't get it to see my MIDI interface.

Rosegarden's MIDI is great. The UI isn't Logic or Cubase but it's
familliar and works. With the Rosegarden 4 tarball from the website,
forget about any audio work. After reading that there is a mysterious bug
with LADSPA plugins and the FFTW library I had to uninstall any app that
relies on FFTW just to get Rosegarden not to crash, locking my entire
system.

Audacity is excellent for small multitrack projects. It's stable and has
lots of good editing functions. It doesn't have a proper mixer though, so
it's pretty much "press record and all the inputs on your sound card start
recording." It's great for overdubs.

The last small track I started was using Rosegarden to sequence Hydrogen
(a drum machine, AddZynSubFx (an additive/subtractive synthesizer) and my
external MIDI synth (a Korg N5) I mixed the whole thing down with
Audacity. It's not done yet.

I made another small track with Ardour, singing, looping and a piano and I
like it but I kept wanting to use soft synths and sync to a drum
machine but couldn't. It's here:

Okay. There were some do or die situations, but nothing more complicated
than using the right installers.

I began by compiling the most recent (at the time) stable tarball
(Wine-20030709.tar.gz) from the Wine website. Then I followed the
instructions on said website to configure Wine without a Windows
partition. Then I installed the bare bones version of Buzz, at the time it
was called buzz_base_install.exe but it appears they have renamed it the
"buzz stealth pack". Whatever. The point is I couldn't install the
"massive" pack, it would just hand until I killed the process.

For reference my Linux audio system is ALSA only (no OSS). The three
things that didn't work:

1) Don't configure Wine as root and don't run Wine without configuring it
first.

2) The version of Wine I pulled out of Gentoo Linux's ebuild tree did not
work with Buzz.

3) Don't open the audio preferences dialog box in Buzz. If it doesn't work
by default, it doesn't work. Opening this preference will only crash the
program since it's looking for a bunch of Windows shit.

Other than that the program works fine with all the bare bones machines. I
haven't tried fancy stuff like soundfonts and VST plugins but the tracker
and soft synths are great.

I think diff would handle it fine, it doesn't have much choice, but you
would get bored paging through all those zeros.

I guess an easy fix would be to crunch up all the 0.0's so that instead of
0.0	0.0
0.0	0.0
...
40000 times

you got
0.0	0.0	40000

(run length encoding) so diff would just sho the difference in the numer,
rather than listing all the lines. It would be a trivial awk script I
think, an exercise for the reader :)

-->><<--__-->><<--

In theory, this is an internal file, and you are supposed to use
/dev/midi01 instead. In practice, it doesn't matter. :)



If you run "aconnect 72:0 80:2", all data written to /dev/midi01 will
be sent to the third output port of the 4x4. To send data in the other
direction, use "aconnect 80:2 72:0".

what works for me is to generate a sine wave (I used wavelab in windows),
then copy and paste it until it is several hours long, then insert 10
seconds of silence at the beginning. Start rolling your sine wav recording
from another machine with a known good soundcard, and start your test
machine recording in the silent period. Its super easy to sync up to your
original wav by deleting all the silence at the beginning.





-->><<--__-->><<--
We use a variety of waveforms, including sawtooth and real music with a
silence leader.  Using Windows tools like Cool Edit and WaveLab it's a
simple task to clip the silence (or anything else for that matter).  I
haven't yet found a Linux tool that makes it quite as easy.  Audacity new
(version 1.2.0-pre1) vertical scale expansion feature is inadequate to
examine samples down to within 1 amplitude bit of silence (-90 dB for a
16-bit sample, or -138 for a 24-bit sample).  Know of any Linux tools that
provide that capability?




-->><<--__-->><<--
Along these lines RME provides a number of audio test files that you might
be interested in. One advantage of getting them from a known source is the
ability to do level matching throughout your system.

Hi,

I'm looking for a filter/software to remove noise from a sound file.
I'm not an audio expert so will try to describe the noise in a way that
you out there might be able to put a name to it and recommend a suitable
filter/software to remove it.

It is a short sharp blip, fairly high frequency, sounds like a compass
point stabbing glass.  It occurs as often as every minute or so in the
two hour sound file.  I obtained this file by recording DAB radio here
in the UK.  I'm presuming the noise is derived from errors in the
transmission or analogue to digital conversion phase of the broadcast.
I think it is due to a signal exceeding line volume.

I've tried the gramofile filter 'Conditional Median Filter II', which
failed to remove the noise.

If necessary I could email a sample of the noise.

I'm using Debian 3.0r0, 2.4.18 kernel.

Thank you in advance :-)

If it's a high pitch and confined to a relatively small bandwidth like I think you're describing, you could probably remove it with a notch filter pretty easily. You may want to start by looking at Freaqtweak.

I wonder why that is. For live playing I have the following set and 
there's no latency at all:
timidity -iA -B2,8 -Os -EFreverb=0 -s 44100

Also, in Muse I've had 4 tracks playing and recorded/played back a drum 
track with it without any glitches of any kind.

Why we're on the subject. Do you have any clue how to use .sf2 sound 
fonts with Timidity? The man pages (along with other sources I've read) 
say that it's possible. I can't figure out how though.

Thanks,

Noise removal tools like that in audacity are for removng a constant
background hiss or hum and would not be suitable for an occasional loud
sqeak. I'm surprised that gramofile does not do anything for it, but I
think your best bet in this case may be to use a sound editing tool like
audacity and manually cut the noise blips. If they are much higher
amplitude than the normal sound they should show up on the display;
otherwise you'll just have to locate them by ear. When you find one you
can either cut the noise out (shortening the recording by the length of
the section you've cut out) or use the amplitude envelope tool to make a
rapid fade out/fade in over the noise. The first method will cause a
time discontinuity: the second may cause an audible droput in the sound.
It depends on the nature of the recorded material and the length of the
noise burst and you'll have to experiment to see which is the least
objectionable.

If the noise is at exactly one frequency, it may be possible to select
a short section containing the noise and apply a filter with audacity,
with a deep notch at the frequency of the noise. I wouldn't advise
applying such a filter all through the recording because it would
probably not sound very nice, and it's a pity to spoil a minute or good
sound just to reduce the effect of a fraction of a second of noise.
Again you'd have to do this for each noise burst, but with a bit of luck
(i.e. if the frequency is the same each time) the same filter setting will 
work on each one.

My mistake, it's a Pioneer PRV-LX1 unit, not a Yamaha: 

http://www.burningbits.com/artman/publish/article_3.shtml

I think I got confused because Yamaha recently bought a stake in a 
Linux firm (Monta Vista) and they were talking about building pro 
multimedia products, but I don't think theirs have launched yet.

Sorry about that! On the plus side, this article does confirm that the 
unit has XLR inputs and is software upgradable.

This looks impressive
http://www.csounds.com/developers/html/dnoise_8c-source.html

This is impressive
http://www.fmah.com/NewSite/HTML/Open/FMAH%20Open%20Denoising.html

But I think it's only windows. It would be cool if maybe you could talk
him into porting it though. :}




-->><<--__-->><<--

 I have a bunch of files like that...

 I used a demo denoiser that I mistook as freeware... and stupidly deleted  
 the originals before I listened to the real output of the program.

 The only way to really remove them is to cut them out. Seeing as they're 
 evenly placed... You can create some nifty sound samples by altering the
 pitch a bit and putting a delay on them. Some of it sounds pretty gorgeous.

 The best thing I've found for noisecarving is a program called in-tune
 {Australian... I believe it's been competed away by some commercial  
 program called intune} It's windows like d/noise. If you can find it {I
 can't} it seems like it might run under wine. {It may have even come with 
 source} Seems to me a lot of small windows sound utilities might.}

 I have had good luck at cleaning stuff up with just the basic tools in 
 snd {{reverb dontcha' know...} :} You can twist the hell out of it too.}
 You might try some of the FFT stuff or even get fancy like this:

 http://ccrma-www.stanford.edu/guides/planetccrma/node48.html

 ...Maybe try mixing it with another file...

} will  work on each one.

Hello,
    Another user struggling with his Quattro here.
I've tried it on three computers with Mandrake 9.1 and then again with 
9.2beta2 on one and whenever I plug it in / turn it on it crashes the 
machine.
If I leave it plugged into the computer when I boot, it gets so far and 
then says

[<e08b56a4>] snd_hack_usb_set_interface+0x14/0x20 [snd-usb-audio]

about fourteen times,
followed by

Code: 8b 02 85 c0 74 06 8b 02 74 06 81 c1 00 08 00 00 8b 52
 <0>Kernel panic: Aiee, killing interrupt handler!
In interrupt handler - not syncing.

Then the lights on the keyboard flash very prettily and the pc won't do 
anything else.

I've tried blacklisting audio usbaudio and usb-midi (because they should 
start with snd- if they're alsa, right?) and it still crashes.

I'm going to try and see if I can install a newer version of alsa, but i 
was also wondering if there was anything else I could do / look for or 
if anyone else was having the same problem.

Incidentally, on the same machine, knoppix 3.2 reports
Soundcard: M Audio USB Audio Quattro driver=audio (so not alsa?)

Any help appreciated
Chris Butt.




-->><<--__-->><<--

The USB drivers get loaded before the sound drivers. You'd have to
modify your init scripts. Or try something like
"pre-install audio viaxxxx".

The recommended solution is, of course, to use ALSA:

	alias snd-card-0 snd-via82xx
	alias snd-card-1 snd-usb-audio
	options snd-via82xx index=0
	options snd-usb-audio index=1


Just use Alsa.


If it works with audio, it will work with snd-usb-audio, too.
(ALSA's soundcard matrix hasn't been maintained lately.)


This depends of your definition of "good". I often work in the
console, without X, so I have a script that pipes the output of
cdda2wav into aplay.  :-)

Hello.

This is probably a bit off-topic. Anyway, I just wanted to write a simple
alsa mixer app (for learning purposes) and wondered if there is some kind
of a high level alsa-lib interface, as it seems to me quite 'deep down'.
The documentation isn't too good either. As I am completely new to this
stuff, I would greatly appreciate any help.

Thanks.

You need at least ALSA 0.9.5.  Mandrake 9.2beta2 only had 0.9.2.  Currently we 
have 0.9.6 in the cooker kernel, but it's broken.  If you just compile the 
alsa drivers from source and install them with 'checkinstall' everything works 
fine.  My quattro sounds great using cooker and alsa from source.  We're 
trying to get the broken kernel alsa working ASAP.


Yes, you need to do this, but it's an unrelated problem.


Same deal, you'll have to blacklist 'audio'.  The problem is that the hotplug 
device list is created automatically from the kernel modules, and there is no 
way for a distribution to 'set' the order hotplug detects your devices in.  So 
since 'audio' comes before 'snd-usb-audio' or whatever, 'audio' gets chosen 
first.  We (Mandrake) are also working on a way to fix this, but we are not 
too hopeful.

Let me know how it goes.

Might that depend on your display resolution? If you zoom an audio 
file to 'fit window' vertically, you're going to see more detail the 
higher resolution your display has, surely? 

Personally, I find 1024x768 isn't enough when viewing multiple tracks.

Gentlemen
My MIDI bone is pretty limited. Here is what I am trying to do (what would 
be the best way)

Soppose I have a midi keyboard attached to an SB-Live with alsa emu10k1 
with all the sound fonts loaded. I aconnect the keyboard with alsa, wow I 
can play the keyboard.

Now I want to be able to play drone sounds while I am playing my keybaord 
(or my wooden flute called bansuri). One way for me would be to keep two 
keys pressed (the first and the fifth of the scale Im playing). Or tell 
Alsa to generate them for me. So how would someone go about doing this. It 
should be pretty easy, all I should need to do is turn those two note on.
And maybe later even have a drum pattern. Any way to script them "Csound 
does come to mind though"

How would someone go about doing it. What is the best way to do it 
(preferably without using a GUI since I want to learn it too). What is the 
best place for someone to look for simple tricks like this.

Regards






-->><<--__-->><<--


Thanks, Daniel.  It says it "employs a Linux-based operating system", I
wonder if that means the code itself will be made available somewhere. 
The $4K pricetag is a bit high, so let's hope there are other options
soon.

In the studio I work in, we do DVD-A authoring under another OS with a
standard $300 4x Pioneer DVD-R/RW and have done up to 8 channels of
24/96 using something called Meridian Lossless Packing
(http://www.ambisonic.net/mlp.html).  The software is rather spendy,
but nothing near $4K.

This is _the last_ thing we need any other OS for in our studio, and I
would love to see linux able to support something like this
functionality.

This is not a solution for you (as far as I know) but this sample library is
simply wonderful for exactly what you are trying to do. He uses VERY long
samples, many of them 1-2 minutes long, with great textures that vary over
time very nicely. I use it for exactly the sort of playing you are talking
about except I'm on guitar or another synth using voice and noise samples.

One thing I find valuable that might be important later is that it makes
lots of sense to layer together the same drone but starting at different
times, or layer together different octaves of the same sound for more
texture.

He did at one time supply some shorter example drones on his web page.
GigaSampler can extract wave files from gig files, so there are
possibilities for playing the sounds even if you don't use GigaStudio. I
think Chicken Systems can also extract wave files from gig files, but I
haven't tried that in a long time. Chicken Systems did have a demo version,
or maybe you know someone with a copy.

Sorry for not having a more complete Linux based solution. I just wanted to
chime in since I really like doing the exact same thing.

 slightly off topic, but I am configuring this for audio, so here goes.

I installed suse 8.2 to a partiotion that was too small, after I realized
it, i expanded the sizer of it using partition magic, and it worked, linux
still botts and everything. using the yast partition utility, it shows the
new size,(until I try to edit it, it shows the old size) It is incorrect in
the lower left-hand corner where it shows the mounted volume space. I also
keep getting error messages reporting the old size when I go to install new
programs, and if I try to go adjust the size of the partition using yast, it
reports the old size. It seems like there would be a really elementary fix
for this.

thanks,
jamie

This is strange, I shopuld be able to find a trick where I send a press 
event to the MIDI engine. I do not know the internals of MIDI, but I am 
still sure it can be done.

This does look good, but no docs and the planet CCRMA version does not 
seem to use Alsa, where I want to use alsa, not /dev/dsp and /dev/midi.

I do not have good experience with CCRMA binaries. I will try compiling it 
myself

I'd recommend the cvs version, which uses alsa midi and has better jack support.




-->><<--__-->><<--

AFAIK SpiralSynthModular does not have support for alsa. It can use OSS
(both audio and midi) or Jack (for audio only, the reliable support is
in the cvs version on which the Planet CCRMA package is based).

MLP is patented 6 was to sunday, I doubt your going to see a free
implementation anytime soon. Its possible that as a comminity we could
licence the format, but I suspect we would still have to pay a per seat
licence fee, so it would not be free or Free.

The software implementation Meridian sell costs about EUR2500. I'm
actually very supprised that the Pioneer box does realtime MLP coding
because as I understand it (war stories from someone in the film industry)
the first pass doesnt always succeed, sometimes you need to discard some
information before it can squeeze the audio into the (fixed) audio
bandwidth allocation. Maybe this stage has been automated, or the DVD-A
spec allows more bandwidth.

Theres more info here: http://www.meridian-audio.com/p_mlpenc.htm

Meridian are more famous for selling /very/ expensive hifi equipment
FWIW.

greetings list,

i'm attempting to get my emagic usb emi 2|6 card working with a debian
linux install on a powerbook g3. i've recompiled the current kernel for
emi 2|6 support as a loadable module, and it loads fine -- all the green
lights are on to indiciate it's working ok. i also loaded the usb audio
module, soundcore, and removed the module for internal soundcard support
since i don't really plan on using it. 

so everything looks like it's working great, but i can't get any sound
output from anything - xmms, pd, audacity, etc. xmms complains of
'permission denied', but i tried 'chmod 666 /dev/dsp' to no avail. i
also disabled all sound servers (eds, artsd) to make sure no program was
claiming the soundcard, and did an 'fuser /dev/dsp', nothing shows up.
most other programs complain that "/dev/dsp: no such device exists." am
i missing a step? should the emi be outputting through /dev/dsp or some
other device?

i tried the alsa route, but apparently the alsa modules don't install
against the 2.4.22 kernel? i get a bunch of errors about undefined
symbols in the usb audio section, everything else seems to compile ok.
so i guess i'll try the OSS route if possible..

thanks in advance for any help,

best,
nick




-->><<--__-->><<--


What distro and what kernel?
We are currently experiencing the same problem with ALL sound cards on 
Mandrake Cooker.  Could you test this on any other cards without changing the 
alsa setup or kernel?
It would be VERY helpful for us to know that this is a kernel problem and not 
an alsa problem.

Thanks,
Austin

No, because when you zoom vertically you see a progrssive smaller range of
amplitudes, hopefully around any value that you want (e.g., 0 dB).  You
should be able to open it up so that you only see 1 bit of amplitude
on-screen at 32-bit word widths, and you should be able to choose any 1-bit
section that you want with the proper labeling so that you know what you're
looking at.

Audacity doesn't do this yet.

Partition Magic will only change information on the partition table.  It 
will work for vfat partitions.
Under Linux, you can create a file system which is smaller than the 
partition it is on.  If you change partition size with Partition Magic 
you are not modifying the file system itself.  The file system remains 
unchanged.
To increase a file system, first copy the whole data to another file 
system.  Then recreate the original file system to the new size.  Then 
restore it.

hi there,

i'm using debian sid, kernel 2.4.22 (just grabbed it yesterday). i was
running the stock debian 2.4.18bf.24 kernel, perhaps i'll try to go back
to compile against that one. but i figured the emi 2|6 loading was
handled by the kernel itself after 2.4.19 so i would be able to get it
work without alsa (which i've never had much luck installing) on a
2.4.22 kernel.

any help is always appreciated!

best,
nick






-->><<--__-->><<--


If you compile the SAME alsa against 2.4.19, and the problem goes away, I'd be 
very interested to hear about it.  Also, could you test your 2.4.22 kernel 
against another sound card but same alsa?

 I use it on white noise or overly noisy synthesized sounds. By removing the
 noise from noise you come up with a reasonable approximation of its soul. :}

 It makes for a great alternative type of synthesizer.

The Pioneer doesn't do the real-time MLP encoding, it's done in
software.  An encoding app writes an .mlp file which is then burned
from a separate tool.

The fixed bandwidth starts to shrink _fast_ with 24/96 and multiple
channels.  4 is usually safe, 6 can really be asking for it.  If I
remember correctly, the data rate for 6 channels of uncompressed 24/96
is close to 14 mbs, while DVD needs less than 9.6.

Compromises have to made sometimes, say if you have a spot in a mix
where all bits are on in all channels simultaneously, it won't work. 
If there is an error or situation that cannot be handled as-is, the
encoder we use can "re-bit" if desired, including smart (even
automatic) 'effective bit' reduction.  So, for example, it can be set
to take bits from the rear before the mains.

Sometimes this is unacceptable and the track(s) must be remastered, but
this is suprisingly infrequent.  Most people in this studio are doing 4
channels anyway (ambisonic b-format, decoded as "square").

Regardless of MLP (highly unlikely, as you say, because of patents) or
something like it, DVD-A support for linux would be a great thing.

Resonant Cities: Call for Sound Works

New Media Scotland seeks sound works for Drift, an exploration of sound art
and experimental music which comprises live events, radio broadcasts, moving
image and publications. We are seeking sound works for 'Resonant Cities':
Internet radio streaming that explore the sonic identity of our surrounding
space and that engage with the fragmented 'noise' of the city soundscape:
people, traffic, communication intrusions, mobile phones, radio traffic,
city wildlife, buildings...

We are particularly interested in audio works which involve one or several
of the following ideas or processes:

- Acoustic Ecology
- Acousmatics
- Phonography
- Sonic research
- Radio art, Internet radio
- Microsound
- Lowercase sound
- Internet communication media and audio streaming
- Electronic communities
- Artists' software for sound and music
- Sound work developed using open source processes and principles
- Generative sound
- Sound archives
- Spoken word / oral history
- Field recordings
- The re-purposing / representing of existing analogue sound recordings,
such as amateur recordings, scientific recordings, and accidental, lost or
abandoned recordings

The works selected by the Drift team will then be curated into themed
streams that will be available via this web site.

Our intention is to expand the audience for the work, encourage appreciation
of sound art, and broaden access to a genre which is too often labelled as
esoteric and inaccessible.

We cannot pay a fee for this opportunity, but we will facilitate the
broadcast of your work.

Eligibility

- Open to artists, musicians, producers in the UK and across the globe.

DEADLINE: 31 OCTOBER 2003

Hi,
I'm noting this evening that on a newer RPWL CD (Stock) with no dead
time between tracks that alsaplayer is making a small, somewhat
frustrating dead spot between each track while I'm listening.

Has anyone else seen this, or am I somehow not setting up something that
would fix this?

This happens with or without using Jack. The driver is a new, unreleased
HDSP 9652 driver if that might make a difference. Alsa is 0.9.6 under
Gentoo.

Thanks,
Mark

I am considering getting a USB audio interface.

My goal is to capture audio for making CDs.  I will capture from line level,
eg., from minidisc or phonograph, and from microphone inputs, eg., for
recording live shows to a laptop.  It should be completely USB powered for
maximum flexibility.  Digital I/O would be great, but is not required.

I am not looking for professional quality.  But I would like something pretty
good, eg., at the level of consumer minidisc recorders.  That is what I am
using to record now.  I don't need any mixing capability.  Plain capture
at 44.1kHz/16bit and optionally 48.0kHz would be fine.

I've seen lots of gear, eg., Edirol, M-audio, etc.  But I have several
questions:

- What is the A/D quality of some of the retail units?

  Retail units:
    Edirol UA-1A, UA-3D (edirol.com),
    MAudio Transit (m-audio.com),
    Soundblaster Extigy, Soundblaster MP3+

  Higher quality?
    Tascam U-122, Edirol UA-20?, MAudio MicPre,

  Professional level (>500USD)
    SoundDevices USBPre
    (http://www.sounddevices.com/products/usbpremaster.htm)

- Is the Mic preamp any good?  Ie., as good or better than the one
  in my consumer minidisc?

- What is the "native" capture mode of these units?

  16bits is OK, but I have heard reports that some, like the Soundblaster,
  capture at 48 or 96kHz and resample for 44.1kHz.  I am looking
  for true sampling at 44.1kHz.

- How can I control record level on these units?

  Some have level controls, but it is unclear what level these control, the
  mic preamp or the line level, or both.  The only one I can see a clear
  "block diagram" for is the USBPre.  This shows separate mic
  and line level gain controls, as it should have.  (See user guide PDF file.)

  If there are no knobs, can the level be set with software?
  Is this what the Linux "xmixer" program does?  The point is that
  I want to:
   - adjust the line level gain *before* A/D is done
   - adjust the mic level gain *within the mic preamp*, to avoid clipping
  So the unit must have internal gain control.


Here is what I have learned so far.

Please help...

AFAICT all above units sample at 48/96K and resample for 44.1K.  So they
will add artifacts, and they will not make an accruate digital copy either!

(1) claims 32/44.1/48k.  Is this 48k native sample rate?
(2) "real time sample rate conversion", is this 96k native sample rate?
(3) rumored to be resampled.


MAudio Transit $100  Y     I/O, N   I/O, NN  I/O, ?   ?       16/24  Consumer
MAudio MicPre  $180  Y     I/O, ?   I/O, YY  none     44.1/48 16     ???
              (150?)

MAudio Duo     $350  9VAC! I/O, ?   I/O, YY  I/O, Y   44.1/48 16/24  Pro

Tascam US-122  $270  Y     I/O, ?   I/O, YY  none     44.1/48 16/24  Pro?

USBPre         $700  Y     I/O, Y   I/O, YY  I/O, Y   44.1/48 16/24  Pro


Possibilities:
-------------

MAudio Transit would be great if it had:
- reasonable quality A/D
- true level controls (from software)
- true hardware sampling at 44.1, 48k and 96k.

MAudio MobilePre looks good if I am happy with 16bit sample depth and
no digital I/O.

Tascam US-122 looks good as well, but is more expensive.

i am trying to install the alsa 0.96 driver with vxpocket support according
to the instructions here:

http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/doc-php/template.php3?company=Digigram&
card=VXpocket+V2&chip=&module=vxpocket

I am in suse 8.2, kernel 2.4.20-4GB
I have the soundcore module installed

under the 'quick install' section I was able to create the directory and
unzip the tar there.

but I get stuck when executing the following line:

./configure --with-cards=vxpocket --with-sequencer=yes;make;make install


after doing a bunch of checks, shell returns the following:

checking for kernel version... The file
/lib/modules/2.4.20-4GB/build/include/linux/version.h does not exist
Please, install the package with full kernel sources for your distribution
or use --with-kernel=dir option to specify another directory with kernel
sources (default is /usr/src/linux).

so I tried it with --with-kernel=/usr/src/linux
and --with-kernel=/lib/modules/2.4.20-4GB/build, neither worked.

At this point, gave up and went looking for a i586 rpm, and installed the
following:

alsa-0.9.6-0.pm.0.i586.rpm
alsa-tools-0.9.6-0.pm.0.i586.rpm
alsa-lib-0.9.6-1.i586.rpm

when I installed the alsa-lib rpm, it said there were some conflicts with
the first one, so i ran it using --force

The vxpocket should apparently be installable thru yasT at this point, but
there still is no module for the vxpocket anywhere. in addition, alsaconf
doesnt run, a window pops up, but then it shuts down.

at this point, I went back to the alsa page, and continued to compile from
source. the libraries installed ok, but when I wen to install the
alsa-utils, it starts, but gets an error, and shell says:

configure: error: this pacage requires a curses library
make: *** No targets specified and no makefile file found. Stop.
make: *** No rule to make target 'install'. Stop.

this is getting really frustrating! any help is appreciated

thanks!

Ah, that explains it. Thanks. So its just video it can do in realtime.
 

Yes, thats very true. Are any other formats allowed for DVD-A? The
audio part of DVD video can use MPEG streams IIRC, and we have free-ish
MPEG encoders. 9+ MB/s of 4 channel MPEG would be pretty high quality.

Otherwise, maybe pioneer would licence thier linux version of the MLP
tools.

-->><<--__-->><<--

It's probably an embedded variant with a lot of non-GPL'd software. 
But you'd expect that they must have made some changes to GPL'd code, 
in which case they should offer source code to anyone who buys the 
unit - since no-one else will have the binaries. I often get the 
impression that some embedded system vendors are testing the limits 
of the GPL though... 


I think that depends on the quality of the unit; I expect pro quality 
video equipment usually costs that much. Of course because we know 
it's really a Linux box, it looks expensive to us - but then Pioneer 
have done all the R&D and put together a complete system which they 
will support. On that basis, it could be a bargain for a busy video 
production firm. 


As much as I respect Meridian for their audio work, MLP is a real 
problem for free software. It's totally proprietary and it needs 
support in hardware players. So if it becomes the standard for 
digital audio, you might not be able to make finished musical 
projects on a free software system.

Cheers

Daniel



-->><<--__-->><<--

Are you talking about your Pioneer DVD-R drive rather than the 
standalone Pioneer DVD recorder here, Kevin? 


Ogg Flac maybe? I guess in the future there will be very few pure 
hardware players - they will all be running some sort of upgradable 
software. So there'll be more scope for new formats. You could burn 
any format you wanted to a data DVD-R and include player software on 
the disc too.


If that's what they are using in the standalone recorder. If that was 
the case, I expect Meridian might object unless they get a 
substantial cut. 

Cheers

Daniel

Just to be clear, we own an internal DVD-R/RW Pioneer drive (sub $300),
not the stand-alone Pioneer setup Daniel was referring to.  The
multi-channel mix (the music) is encoded in software to an mlp, and
then burned with DVD-A authoring software.


Anyone else have more information about this?  Is there another way to
handle high-resolution DVD-A?


I'd be interested in having another look at this question.  What can we
do today with Linux for DVD Audio?  Frankly, I remember being
disappointed with Audio capabilities under the Video specs, which is
why we spent the cash  and bought the mlp stuff.

How far (sampling/bit) does 9+ MB/s get us with, for example, 4
channels of audio (too lazy to do the math -- it's 5 am)?

-->><<--__-->><<--

I was thinking more of things that are supported now. I guess you could do
a DVD-Video stream with no video (or a black screen or whatever) I suspect
most DVD-A players would play that without thinking about it, but it
wouldn't be a true DVD-A - why they are different is a complete mystery to
me.

Ahh... acording to a DVD pressing house website I just read you can store
uncomressed PCM on DVD-A discs, you still only get 9.6 Mb/s, but that just
gives you enough bandwidth for 4 24/96 or 6 24/48 channels.

http://www.amtechdisc.com/dvdspecs.htm

Still, it could be worse, they could be using the microsoft audio format -
we'd have a fat chance of getting a licence out of microsoft for anything
:)


I'm sure Pioneer have to pay Meridian a per product cut (not much, a few
tens of dollars maybe) as it is. Meridian aren't very forthcoming about
thier licencing terms, but thats how dolby do thier licencing.

- Steve



-->><<--__-->><<--

Ah, OK.
 

Yup, PCM.
 

It's 9.6Mb/s, not MB/s (mea culpa), but 4x24/96 will fit.
Also its M = 10^6, not 2^20

The max is 24/192, and you can get 2 channels of that.

Aparently the audio goes in the AUDIO_TS directory, but I dont have a DVD-A
player to experiment with, and I dont know what header/format.filenames
the PCM files have. I wonder if DVD-A players are cheap yet...

- Steve



-->><<--__-->><<--

How many minutes of audio can you get on a DVD-A then, assuming you 
use the maximum bandwidth available to get the highest sample rate 
for your number of channels?

I can imagine this could work quite well without MLP encoding for 
stereo music, as opposed to surround mixes. As Mike Oldfield once put 
it, you only have two ears and your natural inclination is to face 
the thing you are listening to. I don't think he was very happy with 
some of the surround version done of his music, dating back to the 
quadraphonic vinyl days.

A serious drawback I can see at the moment for 5.1 mixes of music is 
that if people are playing them back on systems designed for home 
cinema, the rear speakers are likely to be the those tiny plastic 
ones, really only intended for effects noises. I'm sure that two good 
speakers will sound better than six bad speakers.
 
One factor that isn't really addressed by MLP is that DVDs are really 
cheap to make now. Plenty of films come with a second disc for the 
special features now - so is there any point in using an expensive 
compression system on DVD-Audio that requires hardware support? A two 
disc set is likely to retail for more than a single disc anyway - 
that's marketing for you... 

Cheers

Daniel



-->><<--__-->><<--

According to my maths you only get 65 mins if you max out the bandwidth
allocation (9.6Mb/s, 37.6Gb/disk).

However you get 135 mins with stereo 24/96.
 

Yeah, some of the surround mixes I've heard recently aren't exactly
wonderful either. Personally I find wiring up surround speakers too much
of a pain, I used to have a 5.1 setup in my lounge, but I didn't bother
putting it back last time I moved as I couldnt face all the wiring.

Some random facts that seem relevant:

That are on the order of 100 DVD-Audio disks for sale in the UK (dunno
which are MLP or PCM), prices are the same as CDs. A DVD-A capable player
costs about EUR100, most cheap ones cant play DVD-A.

I cant find a public spec for DVD-A online, but the combination of a bit
of reverse engineering, a DVD-RW friendly player, and what stuff is
available (manufactures tech FAQs etc.) should make it a fun project :)

I don't know. I was without an audio card in Linux for many months, so I

a quick check on the alsaplayer-devel list indicates that
the cdda plugin may have changed from reading the disk as one track
to reading separate tracks, perhaps in Dec02.

i dont like playing from optical disks, but i get the
same thing with ogg and flac files also. I try and think of
it as a track announcement feature :-)

Lurking here, I see you didn't get any replies.  Maybe I can start the

I own the UA-1A and am very happy with it.  Cheap (=A375 when it first
came out), no configuration apart from activating USB audio in the kernel.

I did struggle with the quality of audio produced

http://eca.cx/lau/2003/06/0042.html

But those issues were not related to the UA-1A itself, I merely had to
ensure the source volume wasn't too high.  Ecasound is great,
ecasignalview allows you to set this correctly in realtime.

| - What is the "native" capture mode of these units?

16 bit, 44.1kHz.  Not adjustable.

| - How can I control record level on these units?

Not possible on the device.  You need to be able to do this upstream,
otherwise clipping will be a problem.

|   If there are no knobs, can the level be set with software?

No, no mixer access is available.

Sound quality is good enough for me (a consumer).

hi all,

i use mplayer to successfully play an ".asx" stream [internet radio
broadcast]. but i have every few hours a short interruption in my
internet connection, upto about 10 secs. network connection is
automatically restored. 

after each interruption in the stream mplayer's cache goes empty, so
even with the huge default cache of 8192KB (> 1min audio) i end up
having to quit and restart mplayer.

1) is there any way to get mplayer to try to retry/reconnect after it
detects an interrupt in the media stream?

2) is there any other program that can play .asx streams and will
survive these temporary interuptions of the stream (with caching)?

cau, ALEX

 You could use the script that's on the above mentioned page {the one that
 plays a series of tones} ...change the variables to a tone that's similar
 to your original sound and have it overwrite the tones you want to get rid
 of. {if they are somewhat evenly spaced} Or... you could set it to a tone
 that would mix with the offensive noises and sort of smooth them to the
 point that they could be removed with a traditional filter or eq.

 Again, assuming that they're evenly spaced. All the code's there... you'd
 just have to play with the numbers.

 :} Then again... it's not that tough to just snip them.

 {Maybe if you were to break it up into regions, delete the tones and
 reassemble it? That's simple and would go really fast.}


 You can work this thing. ^



-->><<--__-->><<--

The Soundblasters are consumer/gaming devices. I wouldn't trust them
to have good ADCs.

The other units you mentioned are high quality. I'd guess all of them
are at least as good as your "consumer mididisc recorder".


Yes.


Probably. It's hard to make a comparison when you don't tell what unit
you have, or how good it is.  :-)

(and not all of the above units do have a mic preamp)


Only the Creative units resample AFAIK.


Depends on the unit.

(The UA-1A doesn't have any controls, neither hardware nor software.
The other usually do have controls.)


The website says this is for the digitial I/O, and doesn't mention the
ADC rate. (I guess the ADC can do the same natively; try asking
Edirol.)


This too applies to the digital input only. The website says the ADC
can do 44.1.


The M-Audio Transit and MobilePre aren't yet supported by ALSA, and I
don't know about the USBPre.

I would recommend one of the Edirols, but you have to choose what
features you want.

Hello,

ams-1.5.12 is a major update for AlsaModularSynth. There is now a
"Parameter View" dialog where you can group any parameter from any module
and create your own GUI for your patches. Values for the parameters in
"Parameter View" can be stored as presets and restored via MIDI program change.
There is a new tutorial on modular synthesis (commented patches) and
documentation has been updated as well.

See http://alsamodular.sourceforge.net

Have fun !

When last we checked, not one of Creative's soundcards were bit-for-bit
accurate -- they resampled everything that came into their digital input
whether it needed to be resampled or not.  I'd welcome reports that it is no
longer so.

You might consider solutions other than USB.

Our PDAudio-CF card is a CF card that accepts coax and optical S/PDIF (and
other IEC-958 formats).  It's bit for bit accurate up to 24/192.  It comes
with an ALSA driver.

For a front end, you might consider our Mic2496.  It's a portable 24-bit
dual mic pre-amp and A-to-D converter that provides phantom power and runs
on a single 9 Volt battery.  It will sample at rates from 32 to 192 KS/s.

Please see our Web site for more details: www.core-sound.com

And if you want to stick with USB you might consider M-Audio's MobilePre
USB.  (I'm not certain about the availability of a Linux-compatible driver.)

                                                    JACK RELEASE 0.80.0

JACK is a low-latency audio server, written primarily for the GNU/Linux
operating system. It can connect a number of different applications to
an audio device, as well as allowing them to share audio between
themselves. Its clients can run in their own processes (ie. as normal
applications), or can they can run within the JACK server (ie. as a
"plugin").

JACK is different from other audio server efforts in that it has been
designed from the ground up to be suitable for professional audio work.
This means that it focuses on two key areas: synchronous execution of
all clients, and low latency operation. 

CHANGES:

New transport API (details (of a sort) below).

new example client for control the transport.

ignoring of first xrun on jackd startup.

Much more portable across processors (details below).

jackd -v (--verbose) now prints useful transport state change
information for debugging JACK and clients.  Also reports timeout info
in seconds, not microseconds now.

new dummy driver (along side the existing alsa and portaudio drivers).

Removed incomplete Solaris driver.

support for asymmetric soundcards (for example, es1968 chip has
interleaved stereo for playback but non-interleaved stereo for capture).

Now enforces power of two sized buffer lengths.

Many minor bug fixes.

DETAILS:

The new transport API:
It has greatly changed; if you're a developer, please see the
documentation.  But as a highlight: jack_set_transport_info() and
jack_engine_takeover_timebase(), (the old timebase master interfaces)
now do nothing.  Instead, use jack_set_timebase_callback().

Portability:
<jack/types.h> typedefs are now defined using the C99 standard
fixed-size integer typedefs.  These new typedefs are binary compatible
with 32-bit platforms, but not 64-bit machines.
                                                                                
Programs using printf on these values will get GCC compiler
warnings.  To suppress the warnings, use the corresponding C99
printf specifications defined in <inttypes.h>.  That header is already
implicitly included by <jack/types.h>, but can also be
included explicitly to maintain compatibility with older versions
of JACK without messy #ifdef's.  Adding explicit casts will also
work, but may suppress future warnings you might want to see.
                                                                                
jack_get_sample_rate() now returns jack_nframes_t rather than
unsigned long.  These are the same on 32-bit machines, but not on
64-bit platforms.

These changes were made to accommodate the increasingly popular 64-bit
platforms; specifically, the new Opteron with it's 32-bit compatibility
mode.  32-bit mode probably won't work, but if all programs are compiled
as 64-bit (which Jack supports), it should work fine.

kernel-source-2.4.21 is the latest available in Debian unstable, so you could just get that one, as well as alsa-source, kernel-patch-2.4-lowlatency, kernel-patch-2.4-preempt. You probably also want to apply the capability patch (manually, see jack docs @ jackit.sf.net). I think this is the kernel setup that most people use.

For the 2.6.0-test series, you should get the latest from kernel.org, since the Debian packackes are some weeks behind.

Dear audio users:

Previously I asked about USB capture, eg., to laptop, but I still have
some questions:


1. Is there a "standard" USB interface for audio?  For example, will newer
   devices, like "Audiophile", "MobilePre", and "Transit" from Maudio work
   using some kind of standard interface as the "Duo" and "Quadro"?

   I've seen references to "ASIO" or somesuch.  Does that mean they
   will all function with standard drivers?


2. What do the [alsa|au|x]mixer controls do?

   In particular, if I adjust input gain on (analog) line input will that be
   done before or after the A/D?  Note, I may need to adjust line level if I
   am driving from different sources, like phonograph, cassette tape, or
   electret microphones.

   Similary, for mic in, is there a separate control for this, eg., before
   the mic preamp?

   I could not find this information, neither in docs from Maudio nor in alsa
   docs.  Please point me to the appropriate place if this is written down
   somewhere.  What I am looking for is a "block diagram" showing where
   the amps and level controls really are.


3. If mixers do allow level adjustments above, which USB devices have mixers?

   People have claimed that Edirol UA-1A doesn't have a mixer.
   How about Edirol UA-3D?
   What about Maudio Audiophile, MobilePre, Transit?

   Or, perhaps some devices have mixers, but USB control code is not written?


4. Is it usual to have stereo mic inputs on sound cards?
   Maudio "Revolution" (and most soundblasters?): *mono* input.
   Maudio "Transit": claims stereo input
   Maudio MobilePre, Duo, etc.  All naturally have stereo input.


5. Finally, I noticed that many of the Maudio USB products, like Audiophile,
   Quatro and Duo, need external power.  The funny thing is that they
   need 9 VAC.  AC voltage!  What's up with that?  I was expecting
   some standard DC voltage, eg., 9 or 12V, suitable for mobile use.

   Is there a simple way to power these from DC voltage, eg., batteries?  I am
   willing to open one up (and void the warantee) if necessary.  Perhaps there
   is a psu inside and I can just bypass that and give some standard voltage
   like 5V.

   Len at Core Sound made a portable Duo.  Perhaps he can tell us
   how he did it...


Thanks for all the help.  I'm really enjoying this list...

Hallo,



Well, there does exist a standard for USB (1.0) audio interfaces. I
don't have the link handy but it is online if you google for usb audio
standard. But then not all USB audio devices follow this standard by
the word... 


... and it seems that some with "ASIO" support don't follow it. The
reason, as far as I understand it, is that a fully standard compiliant
device is recognized by MS-Windows as such a device and then MSW
installes its own drivers. But ASIO isn't compatible with standard
Windows drivers, so manufactures cheat Windows to not install its
drivers, so they can install their ASIO drivers instead.  Some
devices, like the Edirol UA-20 even have a switch to choose a standard
mode and the "ASIO" mode. 

But then there also are ASIO capable USB devices like the M-Audio
Quattro, that don't need any quirks at all.

The good news is, that it seems to be not too hard to adapt to that
situation by reading the output of lsusb and change ALSA's usbquirks.h
file accordingly. That's why Clemens Ladisch always asks for lsusb
output when someone on alsa-user has gotten hold of a new device. 

The other problem is firmware: Several devices need to upload a
firmware to their progammable hardware before becoming fully
functional. This has to be done on Linux, too, and certain functions
have to be written for each new device that needs it. 

So the future, as always, is uncertain.


I had or have the M-Audio quattro and the Edirol UA-20. Both don't
have a mixer. The M-Audio Audiophile PCI has a mixer, but that doesn't
work under OSS-emulation. The SBLive has a functional mixer.


Not every card has stereo mic inputs. Not every card has mic
inputs at all. The Quattro has four mono inputs, switchable for line
and mic level.
 

I guess they should come with appropriate adapters for your region.
But the most mobile solution is USB-powered.

Hi,

I'm no expert at what was included in 2.4.22 but I don't believe there where 
any significant changes.

About getting good figures with latencytest, this is quite possible on an 
unpatched system.
The problem is that it's quite hard to produce a test suite that REALLY 
provides a real-life workload, or a worst-possible workload (well, I guess 
that would be easier, but it's uncertain your system will live to tell). 

The tests in the latencytest are good indicators if you have latency problems, 
but they are not fool proof. The problem most oftenly being that too little 
load is put on the system to give concrete evidence.

The only way to know for sure is to test it with something that you ARE going 
to use.

1. A short summary of changes

A set of severe bugs in audio mixing code have been fixed. 
Pyecasound build process has been improved. Reporting chainsetup 
parsing errors has been improved significantly. Support for
the JACK 0.80 transport interface has been added. Support for
reading and writing aiff, snd and au files has been fixed.
Changes have been made to ensure correct operation with 
the NPTL package recently added to Linux kernel and glibc. 
A serious bug in metronome timing was fixed. Minor bugs 
in dynamic sample rate changes, MIDI-server initialization
and the ewf file format have been fixed.

---
2. What is Ecasound?

Ecasound is a software package designed for multitrack audio
processing. It can be used for simple tasks like audio playback, 
recording and format conversions, as well as for multitrack effect 
processing, mixing, recording and signal recycling. Ecasound supports 
a wide range of audio inputs, outputs and effect algorithms. 
Effects and audio objects can be combined in various ways, and their
parameters can be controlled by operator objects like oscillators 
and MIDI-CCs. A versatile console mode user-interface is included 
in the package.

Ecasound is licensed under the GPL. The Ecasound Control Interface 
(ECI) is licensed under the LGPL.

---
3. Changes since last release

* Support for JACK 0.80 transport interface. The recently 
  released JACK 0.80.0 marks another milestone for Linux audio 
  development. The new transport interface allows concurrent use 
  of multiple independent audio applications with full 
  sample-accurate transport synchronization. This release of
  Ecasound provides full support for the new transport API.

  See the following links to ecasound-list postings that 
  give examples of how to use Ecasound with the new transport API:
     http://eca.cx/ecasound-list/2003/08/0005.html
     http://eca.cx/ecasound-list/2003/08/0070.html

* Metronome timing bug. There was a subtle bug in the 
  pulse gate operator that is used to generate the 
  metronome signal. This bug caused a small (<0.5%) timing 
  error in metronome speed. The bug has been fixed, but the 
  change in speed might cause problems for working with 
  sessions recorded with previous versions of Ecasound.
  Thanks to Carsten Bauer for finding the bug.
  
Full list of changes is available at 
<http://www.wakkanet.fi/~kaiv/ecasound/history.html>.

---
4. Interface and configuration file changes

Libecasound interface version number was incremented to 11. 
This release is backwards compatible with interface
versions 9 and 10. See 'ecasound/libecasound/ChangeLog'
for a detailed list of changes.

Libkvutils interface version number was incremented to 6.
This release is backwards compatible with versions 5 and 4.
See 'ecasound/kvutils/ChangeLog' for a detailed list of changes.

Note! Using libecasound and libkvutils outside Ecasound has 
been discouraged since the release of 2.2.0 in Jan 2003. The 
interface changes introduced in this 2.3.0 release should 
only affect a small group of distributors and developers. 
Apps such as Ecamegapedal need to be recompiled only if 
you want to take advantage of the new features introduced
in the latest Ecasound release.

I run 2.6.0-test3 and it works quite well, although I never tried any
patched 2.4.x kernel, so I don't have a lot to compare with. I didn't
apply any patches, just selected "pre-emptive-kernel" in the
configuration. Without X I'm able to run csound with a buffersize of 64
on a medium complex analog style patch and too much polyphony to count
(P4 2400 laptop, using the buildin intel i810 soundcard).

But I'm also interrested in meassuring the performance of my system
including latency more precisely. Is there software outthere that will
to it for me in an accurate way? Are there any patches that can be
applied to the 2.6.0 kernels to improve latency?

Yes. This is the reason why there is one driver (snd-usb-audio) for
all kinds of USB audio devices. (If you're curious, the specifications
are available at <http://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs>.)


The newer M-Audio devices are compatible to the USB Audio
specification after the driver has loaded a device-specific firmware
into them. Such a loader doesn't yet exist for Linux.


ASIO is a driver architecture introduced by Steinberg to overcome the
limitations of Microsoft's MME architecture from Windows 3.x.
It isn't relevant to Linux.


ALSA simply exposes the controls of the hardware, so the
number/type/meaning of the mixer controls depends entirely on the
capabilities of the device.


You'd have to ask M-Audio for this (or other M-Audio users).


The USB Audio specification defines the mixer interface, too, so this
shouldn't be a problem.

Hi,



Thanks, Daniel. The http://www.operswf.org link seems to be broken,
however. It's not totally clear from my Google research, but it looks
like openswf.org was more a respository of information than an official

me like Macromedia has it pretty well locked up.

I took that to mean './configure; make; checkinstall' - is that right?


Austin,
Thankyou for your advice.
I tried 0.9.5 and 0.9.6 on mdk 9.1 but, although it (appeared to) 
compile correctly, the modules wouldn't load, due to a dependency. I 
can't remember exactly which one, except that it had 'print' in it, 
which I found surprising. So it doesn't crash when I plug my quattro in, 
it does nothing. Oh, and the internal soundcard doesn't work either now. 
Do 0.9.5 and 0.9.6 usually compile properly under mandrake?
Having read other comments here and on the cooker list, I get the 
feeling that this maybe more problematic than just my unfamiliarity with 
compiling things. If so, is there an available combination of 
alsa-version + mandrake version + quattro that I can use? Can I cheekily 
ask for a copy of the alsa-driver rpm that you had made?
Alternatively, is there anything I can try, or should do to get current 
ones working? (I am not a programmer)
Yours, hopefully

They sound fine, with S/Ns in the 90's and low distortion.  And they output
a clean 192 KS/s S/PDIF signal.

They're not in the same class as the RMEs and Lynx boards, but then they
don't cost what those other boards cost.

I have forwarded this to the lau list as there should be someone there 
who can help more.

Are you having trouble with capturing the audio or getting the sound of 
the drums?

I'm not very well versed on midi issues but I suggest trying muse, seq24 
or rosegarden. They are very capable apps for working with midi.

The basic problem is making sure the onboard wavetable is being 
accessed. If you are sure this is working the above apps will be able to 
capture the sound relatively easily.

Probably the usbpre is the best bet for this. It does have linux drivers 
for a while now (18months) Just haven't seen one or heard of anyone 
using it round here.

I view the devices like the quattro that need a power supply as similar 
to an fx pedal with one major distinction. They are designed to be used 
by people behind the mixing desk not on the stage.

That means they will have a lot of available power and sockets.

Hello,

I am having some problems getting muse to work with the USB M-Audio
Quattro. I'm mentioning the device because I am not 100% sure the problem
is due to MusE. It could be a Quattro config problem. Anyway, playback
seems to work fine (the song position pointer is moving) but no midi comes
out of the outputs.

The error messages:

MidiAlsaDevice::putEvent(): midi write error, returns -19 expected 28: No
such device

...and at startup of muse I get:

'WARNING: Cannot lock memory:: Operation not permitted'

I'm using Gentoo with 2.4.22 kernel and alsa 0.9.6 compiled from source.
Muse I installed as ebuild from Gentoo.
Does anybody have experience with this setup or know what the problem
might be?

Many thanks in advance,

Jelmer

That's what prompted my question. 

A client has specified Flash audio + slides. Flash makes sense on the
client side, since vast numbers of browsers have Flash plug-ins. I can
certainly use Macromedia's suite of tools on the server side, but wanted
to explore open source options. 

I found one package, Ming, that, evidently, can generate and stream the
slides, but not the audio. Even at that, best I can tell, Ming may not
be that well along-- and may even be orphaned.

Thanks for your repsonses.

Best wishes,

Guitars and bass mostly. Maybe a DX100 keyboard
My system has an Athlon CPU,
Asus A7N8X motherboard with a gig of DDR
I'll be useing a Eurorack UB802 mixer for input.
Could someone tell me a good choice for
a sound card? I expect to spend about $250.

Any advice would be most welcome!

Because file format standards are no good to an artist unless 
your audience can handle the format and the format can handle 
your art?

I know what I'd be using today if I were a cartoonist or animator 
and it ain't SVG... not even sure it can handle some of the 
stuff I've seen people do with SWF.  (Kind of like how the GIF 
patent expired in the US before PNG ever got support for 
animation....)  How much of the stuff at, say, 
homestarrunner.com is SVG ready to handle right now without 
making the end user jump through hoops?  And are the creation 
tools anywhere near as useful or would they be writing XML in 
emacs when they should be drawing funny, TV-quality cartoons?

Ultimately, when you're confronted with a choice between a 
well-supported and complete proprietary "standard" and a 
nascent, not entirely ready for end users open "standard", you 
end up having to decide which is more important to you: your own 
artistic (or commercial) statement or the free vs. proprietary 
debate.  Most artists have enough invested in their work for it 
to take precedence over software philosophy.  Even Stallman's 
hilarious "gather round and share the software" song ended up in 
mp3 format at some point before Ogg was ready... and I can't see 
myself putting music out there in anything but mp3, even now.  I 
gotta think it'll be an even longer wait before you can have the 
expectation that the mainstream user will be able to see your 
visual work if it's in SVG format.

 If they specified Flash... :}


 Check the links I posted in the other message as well as here:

 http://www.oasis-open.org/home/index.php

 {Sorry, I'm in a rush. I don't have time to search out the SVG
 specific stuff. Let it suffice that they have lots of links on
 this page somewhere.}


 There are several alternatives.




-->><<--__-->><<--

Ease of installation doesn't count as much when every proprietary 
browser (and most Linux distributions) comes with Flash 
preinstalled.  


Let me know when it's integrated with the SVG tools, with 
synchronization and all, the way MP3 and other audio formats are 
integrated with SWF.  Have you actually looked at what people 
are doing with Flash these days?  These guys are visual artists, 
and they don't want to hear about SMIL and interleaved MPEG-4. 
They want to hear about "File/Save As", and they're willing to 
pay (and put up with proprietary formats) for it.


When I see someone do something as nifty as the homestar or 
campchaos.com stuff using the hodgepodge of tools and formats 
you're describing, I'll believe that.


Those who do will come to the conclusion (currently a correct 
one) that they'll reach 90% or more of users using Flash and.... 
substantially less for SVG.  And Macromedia will sell another 
$500 worth of Windows or Mac-only software.  Just as I think the 
PNG guys were short-sighted in trying to introduce another 
unsupported format (MNG) for animations, rendering PNG an 
incomplete alternative to GIF, I think that if the SVG guys are 
really trying to replace Flash (rather than just another 
graphics metafile format) they will need to find a way to 
integrate other media that makes sense to artists, not just to 
nerds like you and me.

I am trying to use the hardware wavetable midi synth on my YMF 740C sound "card" onboard my motherboard with ALSA and MusE.  I have been searching through the various sources of documentation trying to solve the mystery but I am stumped.

# lsmod lists snd-mp401-uart, snd-rawmidi, and snd-opl3-lib among the sound related modules.  Can someone give me a definitive answer as to what these modules are?  I am pretty sure that snd-mp401-uart is the wavetable midi synth, and am guessing that snd-opl3-lib are the patches for the legacy FM synth that is also on the card, but I don't have any idea what the snd-rawmidi module is for.  And why is there no snd-opl3 module itself?  Is the legacy FM synth not supported under ALSA?

I checked /proc/modules, so these three modules are loaded, but I can't figure out how to access them generally or through MusE.

Checking /proc/asound/devices does not list any midi devices, (see below):

 [root@localhost root]# cat /proc/asound/devices
  0: [0- 0]: ctl
 27: [0- 3]: digital audio capture
 18: [0- 2]: digital audio playback
 17: [0- 1]: digital audio playback
 16: [0- 0]: digital audio playback
 24: [0- 0]: digital audio capture
  1:       : sequencer
 33:       : timer

As far as MusE goes, I have gone through the configuration section fairly thoroughly but without finding a way to access mp401-uart.  The closest thing that I found was under the midiport configuration table->other raw devices, which brought up a context dialog box which had a choice of raw midi, pipe, or something else which I can't seem to remember at the moment.  I tried entering /dev/midiC0D0 as the path for the raw midi device but that didn't configure a valid midi output for the device.

I want the option to use my hardware synth, as well as the software synths, with MusE and generally under ALSA/Linux.  Does anyone see something I missed?


Thanks,

Barton

Hi,

I know my way around my linux box (kernel compiles et all), and I'm inches 
away from dumping windows completly. Still I've got problems with sound 
recording on linux.

I need help trying to record from Windows Media ASF streams on the net. I 
currently use MPlayer to play those streams, and it plays just fine.

I tried to record from it. I'm using KDE so I fired up KMix and found that 
MPlayer plays through the PCM device (that's what KMix calls it). But I 
can't set PCM as a recording device, so I can't record from it. And since 
MPlayer doesn't play through the KDE sound daemon, can't use that stuff 
either...

So how should I go about this ?

Thanks,

Alex...

The hardware wavetable synth on YMF PCI cards isn't (yet) supported by
ALSA.


snd-mpu401-uart is the driver for the external MIDI port (you'd need a
gameport/MIDI adapter for this). snd-rawmidi is an ALSA module
handling device file management and buffering for MIDI ports.
snd-opl3-lib is the driver for the OPL3 FM synth.


I guess Muse uses the ALSA sequencer. Run "aconnect -o" to see a list
of output ports.


Did you specifiy the parameters for snd-ymfpci in modules.conf?
(e.g. mpu_port=0x330 fm_port=0x388)

Which isn't the case because there isn't (yet) a Linux driver for the

Does this imply that you wouldn't need more than one (stereo) input?

Would it be worth an ALSA or USB developer approaching M Audio

It might be a good idea to also update jack. For a german description of
how this works with SuSE 8.2 see
http://www.suse.de/de/company/press/press_releases/archive03/pc_linux_audio_pipelines.html


On a SuSE 8.2 all you have to do is type "make". This is even shorter than
"rpm -Uvh alsamodular.rpm" ;-)

How is everyone extracting RAR archives? I tried using a shareware linux rar 
RPM, with the rar executable dated March 2001, but it fails on the base drum

Is there a newer linux rar available somewhere, or is it recommended instead

 Use Corels


 I don't think so... Then there really isn't anything for SWF either.
 If you follow the links from Oasis and W3c you will find some pretty
 hardcore tools.

Yeah, maybe I'll try it if I can't find anything else. Not a first choice 
because it seems to be not a simply download and I have to wade through a big

I'll certainly keep it in mind if I can't find an easier answer.

 I've had to install it on every linux distribution I've used.


 Actually, I've looked quite a lot. Have you looked at what you
 can do with Corels SmartDraw?
 

 I'm describing some pretty competent commercial tools. From
 both sides of the linux wall. You didn't check any of those
 links did you?


 Just because it's not been implemented doesn't mean the resources
 to implement it aren't there.

 What do you think's getting done with all of the software that
 is capable of authoring SVG?

 Look at the support linux audio gets as compared to win. Same
 story... Folk get that "only halfway knowledgeable" rumor sort
 of thing that "oh you're wasting your time with that system"
 going and no one bothers to research it any further.

 Windows has much more software and it's a lot easier, etc...

 Skinny Puppy, Einsturzende, Tangerine Dream and Kraftwerk made
 careers on much less than is available in linux now.


 MNG is a far superior format to anything we've currently got
 once the authoring software either gets a bit more complete
 or drops to a price that folk can afford... It will catch on.

 I doubt many folk out there give a damn what extension's
 attached to their file.


 As I said "most artists research their tools to a really high
 degree {large extent, whatever}" {That that sort of thing's 
 gone out of favor in favor of "do only what the customer
 requires" or "always follow the path of least resistance" is
 sort of tragic and hopefully short term. Art will come back
 once folk get tired of being automatons and doing what they're
 told.}

 I "nerd that I am" am pretty typical of old-school artists.

I wanted to use the wavetable synth, even if it was of lower sound quality, as a tool to listen to work in progress so as to reduce the load on the processor.  I have been having some problems with crackling noises which I assume are caused by MusE and or the softsynth overloading the processor when playing back a multitrack midi file.  

Today I did some experimenting with TiMidity as the softsynth for MusE --  I got it configured with timidity -iA in one terminal and muse -R in another.  Then in the midiport configuration it popped up with timidity port 0 for the first midi port.  Unfortunately this produced no sounds on testing.  I opened the track info number and tried to select a preset, but all that it had was "???" -- no patches to select from.

Is there another switch that needs to be thrown to load sounds into TiMidity?  Something else?

I am running the Planet CCRMA acpi kernel, RH 8.0, with TiMidity++  2.11.3-4.1, TiMidity midia instruments 2.11.3-4.1, and eawpats 12-1 installed.  

Thanks,

Barton

snd-mpu401-uart is the driver for the external MIDI port (you'd need a
gameport/MIDI adapter for this). snd-rawmidi is an ALSA module
handling device file management and buffering for MIDI ports.
snd-opl3-lib is the driver for the OPL3 FM synth.


Thanks, got it.  So if I wanted to deal with the FM sound quality I could use the legacy synth?


I guess Muse uses the ALSA sequencer. Run "aconnect -o" to see a list
of output ports.


This is the output of aconnect -o when both TiMidity and MusE are running:

[barton@localhost barton]$ aconnect -o
client 128: 'Client-128' [type=user]
    0 'TiMidity port 0 '
    1 'TiMidity port 1 '
client 129: 'MusE Sequencer' [type=user]
    0 'MusE Port 0     '



Did you specifiy the parameters for snd-ymfpci in modules.conf?
(e.g. mpu_port=0x330 fm_port=0x388)


No I didn't.  So to use alsa with the midi port that is on the motherboard I would need to configure the memory address mpu_port=0x330 in /etcmodules.conf?  Does the line need to go in a specific place, and is that the exact syntax?  Is this documented somewhere?  I have installed alsa manually on this machine before (this time I used  the Planet RPMs and alsaconf) and I don't remember seeing anything that referrred to memory addresses for the midi ports.



Thanks,

Barton

I tried using "rar". It's actually "unrar" that extracts. But this was 
the warning that I saw on the Timidity site...

***************************************************************
Be sure to use rar/unrar >= 2.50.  Versions earlier than this have a bug 
in how file permissions are set on files that span multiple rar volumes. 
  This results in several instruments having all of their permission 
flags cleared. Timidity can not read them and therefore claims they do 
not exist.  If you see this happening, and are using an older version of 
rar, get the new version and it should solve the problem.
***************************************************************

I use the one that comes with SuSE 8.1 (unrar V-3.00-42) and it works fine.

I found out that the Corel thing you're espousing doesn't even 
*support* sound.  Are you sure you didn't mean to pitch this 
thing as a PDF replacement or something?

If you'd been to the links I mentioned, you'd know I'm talking 
about art ("content" if you would argue funny cartoons aren't 
art), not tools.  All the bullet points and buzzword support in 
the world will not make a Strongbad video.


I'm guessing a lot of nice corporate logos and other things for 
which people have been using metafiles over the last decade, 
since SVG is essentially the new CGM/WMF/EMF.  That's certainly 
what Corel would like you to be doing.

For the third time I challenge you to show me some real world 
examples out there on the web, and when you do I'll go to the 
trouble of finding a Mandrake package of an SVG viewer.  I did 
look for the Corel viewer and it appears to only be available 
for Windows.

If it's not yet practical to do an engaging, rich, multimedia 
presentation in an SVG file yet, just say so.  (And don't forget 
that the title of this thread is "Flash audio" and we're 
speaking on a list called "linux-audio-user".   That is to say, 
don't skimp on the music and sound effects.)


They do when they have a choice between "sbemail047.swf" and 
"sbemail047.svg", "assets/sbemail047-01.mp3", 
"assets/sbemail047-02.mp3", "assets/sbemail047-03.mid", 
"assets/sbemail047-04.js", "assets/sbemail047-05.mp3", etc....


We have here two vector graphic formats.  Both are freely 
available and documented with open specifications, yet for 
multimedia purposes, both require proprietary software both to 
create and to view them.  One has been deemed worthy to kiss the 
W3C's ring, the other is already in use by at least 90% of those 
people browsing the web.  That other one has also been mature 
about 5 years longer, its browser plugin is about 8 times 
smaller, it supports mp3 audio, synchronized and embedded in the 
same file, and enough interactivity that many, many people have 
written games using nothing but this other file format.

As for the W3C's chosen format... well, you might be able to 
trigger some external mp3's using Javascript or something.  And 
we heard there are some guys over there doing something with 
RealMedia and SMIL, maybe you could ask them to write some XML 
for you or something.

Sometimes what's politically correct is just not artistically 
appropriate.  Do you want your project to get headlines because 
it's brilliant, or because you made a silk purse out of a sow's 
ear?


Yeah, yeah, true artists don't care about their audience, I know.  
Just the artists that ever *have* an audience.


You mention Tangerine Dream and Skinny Puppy a few times as 
apparent examples in support of your cause.  The truth is, both 
artists chose to release their music in multiple formats so as 
to reach the widest possible audience, despite some of them 
being sonically and technically inferior to the others and 
despite some formats being encumbered by patents and other 
inconveniences.  Even now, you can buy Tangerine Dream on 
tape... not because it's better, but because at the time certain 
of the albums were made, that was where the *biggest audience* 
was.

To summarize this thread: Neither Flash nor SVG allows the easy 
creation of multimedia presentations including audio, using free 
software or otherwise, under Linux.  Both will cost you a lot of 
money to use in the first place and both have non-free browser 
plugins available, Flash currently reaches about 90% of the 
browsers out there, and SVG doesn't appear to have audio support 
at all.

Any questions?

 XML does. Or... "can". That's like saying that html doesn't
 support sound. Do you really need someone to hold your hand?

 Read this:

http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2003-07-25-a.html

 It will give you a bit of insight.


 You and I see art slightly differently. I see valid art as something
 that communicates something halfway worthwhile {Or just communicates}
 This includes a lot of scientific and governmental web installations.
 You don't need the "flash". Some art has even been done using 100% text.

 Don't forget... the customer asked for slides.


 You need to read the above... maybe go through Corel's manual.
 Your viewpoint's far too narrow.


 :} Really? I've just used the SVG version of Mozilla... It seems
 to work just fine. You really don't need any plugins. You do
 have to unzip the thing.

 The point was it's not all that difficult. to get a viewer.


 Then you need to look at helix sound stuff at real.com. {Tho'
 even MS seems to have some stuff up.}

 Don't forget that svg is a vector format... you make drawings
 with it {Tho' it does go a bit beyond that.} In order to do
 multimedia you need to use smil and XML. {Tho' it looks as 
 though the new spec will change that.} It's all part
 of one big package. The reason you use a standard is so that
 the whole mess holds together... gotta' insure compatibility.

 You can write svg with a largish percent of the drawing programs
 out there.


 Why's that? The folk that are putting this spec together see the
 whole web site as an application. {Possibly the entire web.}
 SVG's just a part of it. If you want sound use an mp3 like god
 intended.


 Who told you that?


 I mention them because they were electronic music pioneers that
 made several silk purses.

 You might take a look at Ernst and Davinci... maybe it will
 further your understanding of "art".


 Read the spec.

 Follow a few links.

 Plug some real audio files into your web site.

 Go to this site which has links to all the information on SVG
 that you'll ever need.

Glad to hear it!


I don't see any reason why there shouldn't be direct collaboration 
with M Audio on this particular bit of the software. There's an 
obvious commercial advantage for the company, given that the number 
of Linux desktops may have already passed the number of Macs in the 
world - if not, it's only a matter of time.  

I bought a Delta 1010 specifically to use with Linux because of the 
good ALSA support. It would be great to have full Linux/ALSA support 
across the whole M Audio/Midiman range.

I hadn't intended to launch a flame war with my simple question but,
after all, this pretty much answers it. So, in the end, the heat was
enlightening.

Now, for the hard questions:

1. Which open-source initiatives currently come closest to the goal of
"easy creation of multimedia presentations including audio, using free
software or otherwise, under Linux?"

2. How far away are they?

3. What are they missing?

4. Browser plug-in acceptance is a big issue. But I have seen
proprietary technologies that download the plug-in in real time just in
advance of the audio/video stream so that the end consumer does not need
a pre-installed plug-in. How difficult is this to pull off?

5. Where should we place our bets; e.g. who and how should we encourage
with volunteer effort, cash patronage, etc.?

6. Is it worthwhile to even pursue these lines given Macromedia's
entrenched position?

I realize that this is an audio forum. But wide adoption of
audio-synchronized multimedia would provide a voracious outlet for good
music and sound.

Best wishes,

Hallo,


There is still controversy if Jack is a fitting solution for
"consumer" audio, i.e. mixing system sounds and mp3-files. Jack is
targeted at low latency, sample synchronous, high bandwith audio. dmix
OTOH is actually what pure "consumers" want: dynamic mixing of
multiple streams.

And then there already is Jack integration inside ALSA. See the jack
plugin.

How bad is  2 ms latency?
I'm trying to decide upon a sound card and
I've noticed that the Creative Sound Blaster
Audigy 2 has a 2 ms latency, but offers
"hiss free" audio fidelity at 106 dB SNR.
The Delta 410 has zero latency, but its $200 US.
Now I'm an idiot at this high end sound card stuff,
so I'm not sure what really matters. All I want to do
is use Linux Audacity to record my own multi-track
creations  and convert LP 33rpm records to CD.
I'm sick of tape hiss!  After 4 tracks my analog
tape machine is useless. So I bought this here

record something I can listen to without grinding
my teeth.
Any adice would be most welcome!
 





-->><<--__-->><<--

hmm. I'd look at independent test results before I believe
any such SNR specs. it's possible that they've produced
such a card ...  it's also possible they've fudged the specs.

as for the 2 ms latency... i don't think there's actually any
difference between the cards there, I think they're talking about 
different things.  An input -> output round-trip will 
invariably have some latency,
and 2 ms is pretty close to the hardware limit. The "zero latency"
feature of some "pro" cards means that you can monitor inputs before
they go through the A-D / D-A conversion so you don't hear a
smeary delay on the live parts.  I don't know if the Audigy does
this.

2ms latency wouldn't be noticable, but if you're getting that number from a spec sheet you should know that your actual latency in real life could be quite a bit different. Besides, if you plan to do real multitracking, you may want to look into cards for more professional use. The Audigy2 is more geared towards consumer use.

Also, even though Audacity can mix multiple tracks, this is not it's primary use. It's more of an editor. You might want to consider something like Ardour.

For recording LPs/tapes to CD, try using Gnome Wave Cleaner for getting rid ot the hiss and clicks.

I would personally not choose Audigy, or any Creative card based on the 
EMU10K1 chipset. These chips do all their processing at 48Khz. In other 
words, a 44.1Khz signal comes in, is resampled to 48Khz, processed, and 
then resampled back to the original sampling rate.

Feel free to correct me if I am wrong.

Thanks for pointing this. I was thinking about this since a moment ( I ha=
ve a low-end ymfpci yahama card that processes at 48 khz ). So is there s=
omething good about this?
Is it useful only when I sample at 48 khz and keep the file at 48 khz? In=
 this case how will sound my 48 khz wave file on a machine with a 44 khz =
sound card?

Thanks in advance for responding.

Hi all!

I hope this is the correct list for fluidsynth problems.
Meanwhile I use fluidsynth as a software MIDI synthsizer.
and it works very well (especially because my new PC has 1 GByte
RAM, thus I can use the Fluid - Release 3 soundfont from
http://www.hammersound.net/)

But there are 2 problems concerning strings (program number 48 in GM
scale with all SF2 soundfonts) and clarinet (program number 71
in  GM scale, with soundfont 8mbgmsfx.sf2). It seems fluidsynth does not
correctly handle the sustain level. Please have a look at:

http://rnvs.informatik.tu-chemnitz.de/FLUID/fluidtest.html

There you can find a 4 measure MIDI file "exam_strings.mid" of
strings playing whole notes. If I use the Fluid - Release 3 soundfont
(or any other SF2-GM-soundfont) with Audigy 2- (or AWE 64-)
wavtable synthesizer I hear what I expect: The strings hold
the tone over the whole measure.

If I play the same MIDI file with fluidsynth I hear
a short attack and then the volume decreases for
sustain to a very low almost inaudible level.
Thus, the srings play some kind of stacatto.

The same holds for the clarinet, but only if I use
soundfont 8mbgmsfx.sf2. Interestingly this effect
does not occur in case of choir "Ahhh" . You'll find
example exam_choirA.mid at the same page.

Perhaps the 2 examples can help to clariyfy what
the problem is.

I use fluidsynth version 1.0.3

If you're recording vinyl to hard disk, then latency is not an issue - 
it's only relevant to multitrack synchronisation. The question you 
need to ask is - how many simultaneous inputs do I need? If you're 
recording solo material, building up one mono track or a stereo track 
at a time, then a stereo card would be fine. You only really need 
more inputs if you have a live band.

The M Audio Audiophile (PCI version, not the USB) would do a good job 
of both your vinyl transfers and your music recording.  


I'd disagree completely - the Audacity interface is totally designed 
for multitracking. If you just want an editor for a stereo file, 
Sweep or Glame is designed for that. There's also gramofile and gwc 
specifically for doing vinyl clean-up.


I personally am looking forward to using Ardour, but recommending it 
as a starting point - you've got to be kidding...

er... because outside of the Linux community, the vast majority of the 
web only uses Flash for this sort of thing?

A free software Flash tool for end users is one of those 'missing 
links'. I have seen Flash used as a wrapper for audio files which 
play in the browser - it works really well on Aimee Mann's site:

Click on Listen. No special players or plugins required, other than 
the Flash plugin that most people already have. Now if there was

48KHz is a neat multiple of 8KHz, which I think was the original 
sample rate used in telephony. DAT is also at 48KHz. 44.1KHz for CD 
audio is a bodge designed so that Sony video recorders could be used 
for mastering back in the 1970's:

 Sorry. It makes for a lovely portable tv.


 If you put a dvd into your desktop machine and set the sound at 44...
 it gives you an idea of what the sound's like. {resampling and all.}

 I like Flash... I think some stuff is impressive as hell. It's just that considering the huge amount of work that's been done standardizing svg... fitting it into one zillion and one other specs and getting the whole mess to work together...

 Maybe, if folk could just move actionscript to XML?

i always thought it was to facilitate mixing.

'consumers' expect to be able to play multiple things at
once, with different sample rates. The only way to acheive
this is resample everything to a single sample rate.
48 is a bigger number than 44. 
[In addition, user tests indicated that people were confused by
the .1 in 44.1. :-)]

a card which is concerned with quality will not process
the audio in any way - including mixing - and will switch the 
output to the correct frequency. This does mean however that
the system 'ding' will not sound while you're listening to
an ogg :-)

I believe the firmware loader for using that device under Linux hasn't 
been released yet.

I can see the point of moving the A/D converter outside the computer, 
but I don't think USB 1.1 has enough bandwidth for serious 
multitracking (eg four inputs/outputs or more). This doesn't matter 
with two in/two out cards like the Audiophile, but I think it becomes 
an issue with greater numbers of channels, where using the higher 
sample and bit rates with all channels at once could be a problem.

 USB 2.0 and Firewire should do the job, although I don't know of many 
of these devices with Linux support.

Cheers!

Hello all,

I've been writing a feature on Ron Parker's studio for Sound on Sound 
magazine. It's finished, but we're having a bit of trouble with the 
screenshots, due to a hardware failure at the studio.

If anyone would like to email me directly or let me have the location 
of screenshots of the following applications, I'd really appreciate 
it. Complete desktop shots or individual windows are both fine - if 
there's work in progress visible, so much the better.

1. Ardour - some up to date screenshots? I've already used the ones on 
the Ardour website in an earlier article!

2. JAMin - I've got nothing on this one, image-wise.

3. Ardour Session Exchange - is this a command-line application? If 
so, a screenshot of a terminal maybe?

4. Any other fine-looking JACK apps. Any JACK apps, in fact.

The more, the merrier! PNG format usually looks better than JPEG for 
screenshots, in my experience.

Thanks

Daniel

The reason I personally don't recommend Audacity for multitracking is
that you can't record more than a stereo track. ie. it would be a little
hard to record from or send to a multichannel source. Secondly, I've had 
some problems mixing multiple tracks on Audacity. It doesn't handle
multiple stereo tracks properly. (at least not yet)



-->><<--__-->><<--
I would choose the Delta over the Audigy any day.  Like others have
said, the Creative cards are consumer cards and not really
well-suited for recording in general.  The M-Audio cards are created
with recording in mind and offer you more I/O, better converters,
etc.

As for Audacity, it's easy to use, but last time I checked (a long
time ago) you could only record one track at a time (maybe a stereo
track, I don't remember).  That may be a fine replacement for your
4-track if you only record one track at a time.  Also, last time I
checked, Audacity didn't support real-time effects - only effects
printed to the track.  Somebody correct me if this is no longer true.

Thanks for that! Could you explain what the 'snapshot' part of the

is the master copy?
 
Thanks

Daniel



-->><<--__-->><<--

You need version 1.1.3 or later for multichannel. Last night we 
recorded 8 simultaneous tracks at 48KHz/32 bit float using a Delta 
1010 - no glitches.
 
Cheers

Daniel



-->><<--__-->><<--

That was true until now, although I believe the latest PortAudio 
supports JACK and a version of Audacity incorporating this is well 
under way.

Personally, I like to be able to undo effects because I frequently get 
them wrong! There is a LADPSA effects preview in version 1.20-pre1, 
which helps. But for real-time effects work, would an in-memory 
rather than disk-based application be better?
 
Cheers

Daniel

Daniel,

	In addition to the three JAMin screenshots (jam1.png, jam2.png,
jam3.png) I've added one showing Ardour feeding JAMin which then feeds
back to Ardour recording to a stereo track.  All the connections are
handled by QJACKConnect (also on screen).  It's a bit busy but pretty
simple really.  I know, I should have run all of the Ardour outs to a
bus and then routed the bus outs to JAMin but I'm not that
sophisticated.  Ron and I have talked about this setup before.  It's a
bit weird, almost like mixing and mastering at the same time.  The first
time I mentioned it to Ron he thought I was a few fries short of a Happy
Meal (TM).  The screenshot is at
http://myweb.cableone.net/eviltwin69/master.png.  If you want I'll do a
couple screenshots of just Ardour.

Daniel,

	I've added master.png and ardour.png.  Unfortunately I sent all the BS
I wrote about master.png to linux-audio-user and not directly to you so
it's probably going to take a while to get there.  ardour.png is just a
simple shot of Ardour beta3 running.

 Friends of Ed had a heavily xml laden page advertised as their "site of the week", Flashkit has links to Oreillys actionscript pages, there are all kinds of links to pages that feature xml, javscript, etc pages... SVG being a vector format... it would seem that all that's really different is the drawing. Everything that makes it move, etc is pretty much shared already.

Hello!
  The sustain bug, I didn't know, that it's still in there. But it is easy to
fix. In the source-tree you have a file called fluid_voices.c or something
similar. I think this would be under the directory src. You edit this one.
Somewhere around line 1367 it says, that a counter (COUNT or COUNTER) should
be set to a number. After that you add if (COUNT ==0) COUNT = 98; - This
should solve the matter. If you need more specific instructions (they are
vague), then ask again and I'll look up the proper new line-number and write
you the code bit, which is needed. But rest assure that this is really only a
matter of adding one line. Btw. The problem also occurs with the jeux d'orgue
soundfont.

Ardour has a snapshot feature which is used to save different versions
of the same session.  The snapshot list is just a list of those.  It's
not so much a syncing.  It's more of a "copy this snapshot and any
needed audio files".  So in a sense, the server you connect to is the
master.  But if someone connects to you, then you're the master.

Hi all,
I'm running Mandrake 9.1 with multimedia kernel and applications that 
come mostly from thacs RPMS.
I have just download jack 0.80.0, qjackctl (great tool !!) and when 
starting jack with -R option I get the error message : "cannot lock down 
memory for RT thread".
Even with this error rosegarden work fine when using only the wavetable 
synth of my sblive (no xruns, even under KDE, switching windows or doing 
other nasty things that usually cause xruns).
The problem is that I cannot connect softsynth to jack (I get the same 
RT thread error), I have tried with ams --jack and zynaddsubfx.
I have seen on list archive several users having the same problems but 
no clear answer on the reason of the problem ....

Thanks,
Christophe

I tried to find this line. But if I:

  $ cd fluidsynth-1.0.3/src/
  $ fgrep COUNT *

I get:

  fluidsynth.c:#define DEFAULT_FRAG_COUNT 32
  fluidsynth.c:#define DEFAULT_FRAG_COUNT 16
  fluidsynth.c:  int c, i, fragcount = DEFAULT_FRAG_COUNT;


In my opinion there is a more serious problem: The strings are much
too quietly, already from the beginning. And the volume difference between
attack and sustain is much too big. Again: It concerns only the
srings of all soundfonts. And the clarinet of some soundfonts.

Perhaps the SF2 format has still a special statement which orrcurs 
very seldom and which is ignored by fluidsynth.(?)

back a multitrack midi file.  

Today I did some experimenting with TiMidity as the softsynth for MusE --  I

Then in the midiport configuration it popped up with timidity port 0 for the

Is there another switch that needs to be thrown to load sounds into TiMidity? 
 Something else?

been working rather badly lately) one of it's counterparts, e.g. savannah?

audiogfx.sf.net ?

Emillo, since you where working with blender; would you mind putting up the 
original, blender file with similar license? Could perhaps serve as a basis 
for others wishing to create graphics.

Yes. (You have to load instrument data with sbiload before using it.)


Neither the MPU port nor the FM synth are there.


Put the following line anywhere in you modules.conf (if there is
already a line beginning with "options snd-ymfpci", simply add these
parameters):

	options snd-ymfpci mpu_port=0x330 fm_port=0x388


In the entry for your card at <http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/>,
but the options aren't really explained.

Or another possibility could be that he doesn't actually have memory
available? If he's got a 128MB machine and some other big apps loaded, then
he might not have the 30MB or whatever it is that Jack requires?

Just a thought.

Cheers,
Mark






-->><<--__-->><<--

I don't think it's a hardware problem, I have 256MB, it should be enough.
Can it be caused by the temp files used by jack or by the shared memory 
file system shmfs. I have had problem mounted it last time and I wonder 
if I don't need to have jack install after having the correct shmfs support.

I guess I'm thinking of apps like Sonar where you plug effects in a
processing chain.  Undoing is unplugging and the effect has no
"effect" on the audio track itself, just the mix.  You also have the
option to "print" the effect to the track if you want to save CPU
resources.

I've not quite gotten far enough with Ardour to see if it supports
that, but I assume it does.  Besides you can use external
Jack-connected apps for that if Ardour doesn't have it built in.

I've seen this exact message when loading large sound fonts in Fluid Synth.
I had 256MB at the time.

Jack takes more memory than you first think, or at least it reports that
it's using a lot. If you have lots of free memory then this is not likely
the problem. I only offered it as an alternative idea, not as a solution.

It could be, I suppose, caused by where you are mounting the Jack tmp
directory. You might reply back with both:

1) the results of 'top' before you start Jack.

2) Your fstab file contents

Please remember Steve's comment. Possibly there is a permissions problem.
Could your shmfs only be allowing root to gain access?

Hello list, 

Anyone here have any experience getting alsa to work with the EMI 2|6? I'm 
having some problems getting everything to play nice together. Using aplay 
with no options gives me some errors about sample formats (according to 
/proc/asound/card0/stream1 the acceptable sample formats are S16_LE and 
S24_LE). 'Using aply -d plughw:1 sound.wav'gets me a little further - aplay 
tells me: 

"Playing sound.wav - Signed 16 bit Little Endian, 44.1KHz, Mono." Then
it informs me "xrun - at least 0.074 ms long!" and then I get an error
message : 

Alsa lib pcm_hw.c:494:(snd_pcm_hw_start) - SNDDRV_PCM_IOCTL_START failed
: Broken pipe. 

And of course I get no sound. For the record I'm running debian sid, 2.4.19 
kernel, alsa 0.9.6 on a G3 Powerbook 500. Perhaps something wrong with my 
alsa lib? Or am I missing something here? Any help from someone with any 
experience with the EMI 2|6 would be greatly appreciated!

Greetings:

  While profiling FLAC I discovered that the format includes a metadata
format for including cue sheet data for use in CD mastering
applications. When I looked for a Linux-based cue sheet editor I found
only the very outdated CDB (CD Builder), which, true to its author's
advice, will not build under GTK 1.2 or 2.x. I thought perhaps JAM would
concern itself with cue sheet data but I think that's not its domain
(the FLAC docs note that the cue sheet data is intended for CD authoring
apps). 

  Btw, I downloaded and tried running some Windows-based cue sheet
editors under WINE, with varying success, but none were completely
useful. Maybe I should update my WINE installation again, but I'd prefer
a Linux-based solution anyway.

  Sorry for the cross-post, I thought perhaps someone on LAD might be
developing such a creature (?). Do any users on LAU utilize a cue sheet
editor for any of their work ?

Best regards,

== dp



-->><<--__-->><<--

You mean PQ codes? According to Bob Katz (I'm just reading his book on 
mastering) these should always be supplied as hard copy to the 
mastering house, in addition to any metadata supplied on tape or 
disc. In the early days of CD production, the PQ data would be 
entered by hand at the CD plant anyway.

Cheers

Hi!
  I just looked it up again. You go into your directory src, then you edit the
file: fluid_voice.c.
  There you go to line 1372 (for version 1.0.3) and there you'll find:
    count = calculate_hold_decay_buffers(voice, GEN_VOLENVDECAY,
GEN_KEYTOVOLENVDECAY, 1); /* 1 for decay */
  After this line you can directly insert something like:
  if (count <98) count = 98;
  If this doesn't work, you can go down a bit to line 1384, there you'll find
the same only with RELEASE, after that line you could try the same procedure.
I'm not sure weather this helps a lot with your problem, but it's worth a try.
If this doesn't help your attack problem, look a bit more up, you see that
this section of code delas with the complete volume envelop.
  Kindest regards

  Many thanks to Rob and Emiliano ! GCDMaster looks like just the thing
I wanted.

-->><<--__-->><<--

First of all: Thank you for giving me a pointer into the fluidsynth program.

This didn't help but I changend in line 1362 after:
  case GEN_VOLENVHOLD:                 /* SF2.01 section 8.1.3 # 35 */
  case GEN_KEYTOVOLENVHOLD:            /* SF2.01 section 8.1.3 # 39 */
    count = calculate_hold_decay_buffers(voice, GEN_VOLENVHOLD, GEN_KEYTOVOLENVHOLD, 0); /* 0 means: hold */
    if (count < 98) count = 1771;
                            ^^^^^
Now the strings hold the tone but there is a small problem in release.

 I assume I could fix this similary. But more interesting is: I printed out the "count" values at
	GEN_VOLENVHOLD
	GEN_VOLENVDECAY (GEN_VOLENVSUSTAIN, GEN_KEYTOVOLENVDECAY)
	GEN_MODENVRELEASE

If I play the strings (program number 48 in GM scale) the values are:

	GEN_MODENVRELEASE: 1191
	GEN_VOLENVHOLD: 1771
	GEN_VOLENVDECAY: 1771

If I do the same wit choir A  (program number 52 in GM scale) the values are:

	GEN_MODENVRELEASE: 728
	GEN_VOLENVHOLD: 792
	GEN_VOLENVDECAY: 19464

The difference is surprising because the strings and the choirA have certainly a
similar envelope.

Therefore I changed again at:

	case GEN_VOLENVHOLD:                 /* SF2.01 section 8.1.3 # 35 */
  	case GEN_KEYTOVOLENVHOLD:
		count = calculate_hold_decay_buffers(voice, GEN_VOLENVHOLD, GEN_KEYTOVOLENVHOLD, 0); /* 0 means: hold */
		if (count < 98) count = 19464;
                                        ^^^^^

and at:

	case GEN_VOLENVDECAY:               /* SF2.01 section 8.1.3 # 36 */
	case GEN_VOLENVSUSTAIN:             /* SF2.01 section 8.1.3 # 37 */
	case GEN_KEYTOVOLENVDECAY:          /* SF2.01 section 8.1.3 # 40 */
		count = calculate_hold_decay_buffers(voice, GEN_VOLENVDECAY, GEN_KEYTOVOLENVDECAY, 1); /* 1 for decay */
		if (count < 2000) count = 19464;
                            ^^^^          ^^^^^


... and the strings are still too quietly but if I increase the volume of the single NOTE_ON commands the strings
sound (almost) like on hardware wavetable synthesizer (with small distortions).

Because of the great differences (1771 << 19464)  I assume still a SF2 interpretation error.

Feel free to give me instructions about what else shall I test.

Hello list,

I'm a new convert to linux audio having used Logic, CoolEdit, rebirth 
and Acid - but there is one thing that really puzzles me ...

When I use one of the above windows apps there is always a loop facility 
where a section/region/chunk of the track can be easily looped just by 
selecting it with the mouse and pressing play ... I've downloaded 
ardour, rosegarden, gnusound, audacity, and others and none of them have 
this instant loop facility (er, except sweep, which is fine, but I need 
a loop mixer/editor like logic or acid to put my samples together).

Am I the only one to work in this way?

The other thing with ardour (fantastic looking) is that I can't get 
samples to sit next to each other (snap) unless I'm really careful with 
the mouse - any ideas?

Thanks in advance for any advice!

Andy





-->><<--__-->><<--

No, there are others that work like you do. You can join one of the
application development lists and make feature requests. Most of the
developers pay pretty close attention to inputs they get there.



Make sure you set the snap parameters correctly in Ardour and it should
work. I haven't used Ardour in 4-6 months now, but it used to work.

Hi Joerg!
  I can't help you much further. I only knew this little twist, because
someone else, told me to look there. What you did looked sometimes a bit fishy
to me. I mean:
  if (count <98) count = 1771;
  This seems to be a great difference in numbers. I'd really suggest something
like:
  if (count <1771) count = 1771;
  or: if (count <98) count = 98;
  Have you checked your little hack with other instruments? What do they sound
like? Still ok?
  If you need more help, better ask Josh Green, Peter Hanappe or someone else
from the fluidsynth-team. If you are really interested in fluidsynth, I
suggest the fluidsynth mailinglist. Their mainsite is at:
  www.fluidsynth.org. There you'll see a link to the list.

Rosegarden-4 has a pretty quick loop facility.  To set a loop in the 
main window, make sure the rulers are visible (Settings | Show Rulers) 
and then shift-click and drag the region you want to loop on the ruler 
at the top or bottom of the main canvas.  You can toggle this loop 
using the loop button on the transport window.

You can also select some notes in the matrix or notation editor and then 
use the "Set Loop To Selection" function on the Move menu.

You can't loop a segment just by selecting it though, no.  Wouldn't that 
interfere with editing during playback?  Or do you mean only if you 
select something before hitting Play?


Chris




-->><<--__-->><<--


In the Windows apps I think the original poster was talking about,
either Acid or Sound Forge types, there is generally an audio preview
area in the screen somewhere, sort of like an audio preview area. It's
not the main app, but just an extra mini-app, sometimes with its own
mini-transport. If you select an audio segment, possibly before
inserting it into a real track, you might want to preview it, so there
is a way to play the segment from there. (Imagine a file manager with a
list of files. You highlight one and you hear it at the tempo of the
session. Remember Acid changes the tempo of everything on the fly.)

In Acid it's useful in the sense that you might be chopping just a
portion of a loop to use in a track somewhere and you want to hear how
that little piece of audio is going to sound. These little mini-apps get
used in that way.

Rosegarden & Ardour don't support that sort of functionality yet, as far
as I know. I doubt it would be that hard to do, once Rosegarden gets to
a point where there is more audio capability.

In Ardour, there was discussion at one time about having the ability to
automatically repeat audio segments over and over, just like in Acid. It
was in for a while as a patch from someone. I don't know if it ever made
it into the main code stream.

Just something to keep in mind. I don't know about your hardware, but 
with mine, theres a limit on the size of a sound font that can be loaded 
into the wave table. When I tried to load a 128MB file, only certain 
sounds got loaded. But with Timidity using the same sound font, it all 
loaded and was usable. Just something to keep in mind. I'm glad someone 
else posted this (prior) to me aquiring the 128MB sound font. Otherwise, 
I would have loaded it into the wave table and assumed that there were 
only a few sounds in the sound font. I probly would have disgaurded the 
sound font and lost out on some really good sounds.

If it work as root it should not be a problem of memory !!

jackstart creates 4 tmp files with my user name :

jackd as root does the same but the owner of the tmp files is root of 
course.

Well will work as root for the moment !!

I'm having problems recording from line in.
Without knowing exactly what's going wrong, all I
can say is that I can only playback "silence."

As I'm recording, I can hear the audio being fed
back through the external speakers. I can also use
various mixers to mute/unmute and set the volume on
the "Line" setting. So I'm pretty sure everything is
hooked up right.

I initially tried using sox/notlame/mpg123 ...

# record and encode
$ sox -t ossdsp -w -r 44100 /dev/dsp -t cdr - |
  notlame -k -v -S - /tmp/out.mp3
# playback
$ mpg123 /tmp/out.mp3

I've since tried to simplify things ...
$ rec -d /dev/dsp /tmp/out.wav
$ play /tmp/out.wav

Neither of them work. 

System details are provided below. What else can
I do to troubleshoot this?

Thank in advance

Apparently, I'm running arts. Great. One more thing
I don't really understand.

Now, I've been to arts-project.org and see that
it's the Analog Realtime Synth, blah blah blah.

Questions: do I need it to capture audio from
the sound card? Should I be trying to trouble-
shoot it? Or is it getting in the way of things?

artsd --help says you can select ALSA as the IO

I'm not that savy, but I know that I had to play around (a lot) with the 
various setting in "alsamixer". It's command line, so type "alsamixer" 
in the shell.

I will tell you that (from what I understand) it lists things that 
probly don't even pertain to _your perticular card_. So that makes 
trying all the settings more confusing. Also, I have found that 
"unmuting" or toggling "capture" modes on certain settings can cause a 
high pitch sound. So I would suggest that you already prepare (in 
another shell) the command that will restore your original "state". My 
main "state" file is located at /etc/asound.state. So I will use that as 
the example. If you get in trouble, do...  "alsactl -f /etc/asound.state 
restore" (no quotes of course).

Here's the catch though (at least on my set up). I found that the 
"/etc/asound.state" file changes every time I change my alsamixer 
settings (even if I'm _not_ root). So I would suggest that You move the 
"asound.state" to a different location and do... "alsactl -f 
/NewLocation/asound.state restore" if You get into any trouble. Once I 
get the right settings, I save the file to a different location by doing 
(I hope the syntax is right) "alsactl -f /NewLocation/NewName.state 
store". With that quirk of it always writing over the original 
"asound.state", I have "/NewLocation/NewName.state" always handy. In 
fact, I have it load during bootup because the original 
/etc/asound.state is always different with every session. But you can do 
what you need to do.

In alsamixer, I toggle "mute/unmute" with the "m" key (if it's muted, 
you will see "MM" at the top of the slider)... toggle "capture" mode 
with the space bar (the "-----" above a slider indicates it has a 
"capture" mode, and the word "CAPTUR" above slider means it's 
activated)... increase volume sliders with the "up" and "down" keys... 
and move from slider control to slider control with "left" and "right" keys.

Good luck,
Rocco

Once I found out that KDE starts the aRTs server
upon KDE Startup, I shut the think off immediatly.
I don't need another thing getting in My way. I do it
by going to...

--> Control Center --> Sound --> Sound Server --> (un)check "Start aRTs 
Server on KDE Startup"

I think it may require a reboot to (un)activate aRTs (just to taunt
you further... hehe).

Hi,

Sunday 07 September 2003 12:04 skrev Rick Taylor:

Though this is accurate, it's only half the story about aRts.

I think this requires a short introduction of sound in linux to give a better 
understanding to the subject at hand. 
Atleast the parts of it that I'm aware of and think I understand. Don't hold 
your breath...this will probably be longer than I intend to, relax and enjoy.

<Rewind ...10 years>
<Stop>
<Play x 10>
<theatrical beginning>In the beginning there was nothing.</>

Then there was a company, Open Sound System, with audio drivers for unix 
derivatives, I don't know if they targetted Linux in the beginning, but it 
was the first that was available in linux on a grander scale. They got a cut 
down version of their drivers included in the kernel, OssFree, these are the 
drivers accessed through /dev/dsp.
One problem with these drivers was that they where only for one user at the 
time. 
If you started e.g. XMMS and played some music and after a while some other 
app wanted to use the soundcard it had no choice but to wait for the current 
user to finish up. A very troublesome environment.

To solve this the concept of sound-servers was introduced, in the beginning 
the most spread sound-daemon was ESounD (Enlightment Sound Daemon), which 
worked rather good for it's design goals. But it got a lot of bad press for 
it's below par sound quality.
ESounD may still be the sound daemon used in Gnome (?), it was at one time 
anyway.

Other sound-servers where born, KDE started out with a sound-server that was 
even worse than ESounD, at some point they decided to use something else. 
They settled for ARTS, yes... the software synth... reasons being unknown to 
me, but ARTS is quite advanced, and developed in C++, it fit the KDE 
architecture rather well, SO BE IT. ARTS is from now on formostly a 
sound-server. The goals of producing a software synth lives on, but I think 
very little work is being directed towards that these days, maybe later on...

At some point along the way, during the sound-server development, ALSA was 
developed as a new sound-card architecture. ALSA, now the sound-driver 
formostly being used in Kernel2.6 will soon be what most distros use, as 
DRIVER.
But ALSA still doesn't remove the need for a separate sound-server. ARTS and 
other sound-servers will live on for this purpose. (There is a Mux plugin in 
ALSA that someday will make usable sound-server capability IN alsa, but I 
don't think this is reality yet, and I don't know if this is the right way to 
do it.)

It could also be noted that many newer consumer-grade sound-cards has built in 
mixing capability and can handle several apps accessing the card at once 
(E.g. SB-Live and relatives).

These days lots of apps have output plugins for ARTS and it has evolved into a 
very good sound-server. With one exception, real-time-ness, which is 
something that is deemed necessary for any professional audio app. 

Hence pure audio applications has almost always used the sound-card directly.
Using the sound-card directly is the way it is done with pro-audio in other 
operating systems also so we this was almost inevitable.

The story does however not end here, one can even argue it starts here. Some 
of the great brains of the Linux-Audio community came up with an alternative: 
Enter JACK, which is a major step in pro-audio sound-server technology. A 
sound-server with one major design goal, everything should be possible to be 
done in hard realtime.
As an exercise for interested reader, go to http://jackit.sf.net and find out 
more about JACK.

There has been and are other similar technologies around also, e.g. GStreamer 
which I know little about. The scope is getting broader for these and similar 
technologies, they are more oftenly called media-frameworks.

Ok... that is definately enough for now...

 I'd used it to that point... It was one of the first {maybe the first 
 modular synths} Actually, I never could get it to work right. I did manage
 a few *really* nasty crashes with it... It was one of the reasons I 
 started messing with Audiomulch a while back... I like the whole idea.
 It makes things very simple. :} Never could get Brahms to compile either
 {I still can't get it to compile for that matter {But I am still trying.}}
 I did get Cecilia to make some lovely noises and had a nice time playing
 mp3s in XMMS.

 Strangely enough, I haven't been able to get the newer versions of
 Cecilia to do much... It's a great program but I'm really more interested
 in common music and scheme. Snd didn't seem to be such a great program back
 then... I really didn't like it as a matter of fact. It's come a long way
 since then. {I wonder if Cecilia could be modified to work with lisp?}


 http://www.arts-project.org/doc/handbook/introduction.html#what-is-arts



 What if you were to use it as a synth and make music with it? It does
 seem to be much more developed than a lot of linux sound software. {It's
 grown a hell of a lot too.}

 Maybe it could be made Jack compatible? {Seeing as Jack's gotten so popular
 these days.}

Robert,

Thanks for the back-story. It was more helpful
than you could know. There are lots of very-detailed
faqs out there, on numerous topics, but precious
little that attempts to sum it all up.

I've been able to make some good progress. Knowing
what components are required or optional for what
I'm trying to do was a big help.

So arts lets multiple apps send audio to the sound
card? Rather than write directly to /dev/dsp, they
presumably send data through arts. What about the
reverse direction? I guess I'd need a record app
that reads from arts rather than /dev/dsp?

At any rate ... I disabled the arts server, and can
now record from /dev/dsp. I'll have to determine
based on experience whether I miss any of the features
that arts provided. 

Thanks all.

I'm glad Luis sent this message, it addresses a particular concern. I
also tried building gcdmaster but ran into a by-now familiar problem. I
have both GTK 1.2.10 and GTK 2.0 installed on my machine. While
gtk-config is wonderful, not all legacy GTK-based apps use it, which
results in a poor situation when it comes to compile time: either I give
it up or I set up a bunch of links that will need to be removed after
compiling. Not the best solution either way.

As it happens, my compile of gcdmaster fails anyway. If anyone wants to
know, here's the fail point :

I'm having a hard time bringing my new RME pci interface and Multiface
to run... and would appreciate some help ;-)

I'm working on Debian/unstable, have compiled the kernel with lowlat and
preempt, installed ALSA, inserted the hdsp modul, made a basic ~/.asoundrc,
compiled hdsploader from alsa-tools and with the friendly help of Thomas
Charbonnel also hdspmixer.

hdsploader loads the firmware (well it does the *second* time I run it,
which is a known problem, as Thomas told me).  The error LED on the
Multiface is off.  Input (on analog input1) *does* show in hdspmixer
(only in the *input* channel, nowhere else), but I can't get any sound.

Hmm, here I have the first question: Do I have to run alsamixer or
hdspmixer or both to unmute the channels? (I have tried all of this).

I have tried to feed a signal to analog input 1 and get it out from
analog output 1.  I have also tried to set the internal routing with
amixer, but don't know if I have done that right...  Well, the doc
says hdsp defaults to route inputx to outputx anyway.  But I can't
hear anything...

I have tried 'cat some.wav > /dev/dsp' no sound, no errors.
(where would the error message show up?)

I do hear a high pitched hiss on line out, nothing else.

Please tell me:  What would be the most basic procedure that should
produce sound output on the Multiface?

What diagnostic information can I give you to find out why it is
not running yet?

Thanks a lot for any hints!
Robert Epprecht

Robert,
   Hi. I can speak with no great authority on the specific configuration
you have, but I do use an HDSP 9652, so there are similarities.

1) do an lsmod and send back the results. This will let us see what's in
memory for drivers

2) Show your /etc/modules.conf file so we can see what you're trying to
run

3) Run hdspmixer and see what signals you see when running audio through
it. alsaplayer is fine for this purpose.

4) Run hdspconf and look at the way you have clocks set up. (I think
this will work for your hardware, but I'm not sure.)

Good luck,
Mark

First, install alsaplayer, as Mark mentioned. 
http://alsaplayer.sourceforge.net

I think that the answer lies in hdspmixer.  The analog
output on the multiface is where you need to route your audio.
Chances are, the stereo output of alsaplayer and most other apps
will show up on playback channel 1-2.  So what you need to do
is right click on the box beneath the fader of channel 1 on the
*middle* row of faders, and select Analog from the popup menu.  Now move
that fader up to 0db.  This sends playback channels audio 1-2 to the
analog outputs. 

Now, *be careful*, if you have headphones plugged
in, some are more efficient than others and this output could
damage them and your ears.  You can control the level of the analog
output with the fader at the bottom right corner, start it at
the bottom, and bring it up while playing something with alsaplayer
to find the right level for your headphones.  If you are sending
it line-level into something else, you can keep it at 0db.

I recommend that you read RMEs TotalMix webpages well, to grasp
the full power of this mixer, it can definitely be confusing.

You hit the nail right on the head. I can't tell you how much time I 
spent researching something (for weeks even) that didn't even pertain to 
my (perticular) goals. Heck... a person has to know --what it is-- (and 
were it fits into the Linux/Audio/Sound picture) before you can even say 
to yourself "do I need this"? That's where the majority of My time 
working with Linux/Music/Sound has been spent. It's no one's fault. In 
fact, there's many really wonderful people on this list that have 
educated Me and made that quest shorter for Me.

I want to mention another thing that (I think) you will find valuable...

Since you don't seem to be afraid of the command line, get "ecasound". 
It is a command line mulitrack-recorder/sound-effects/file-converter (I 
wont list any more of it's features because I will leave some out). It 
is very powerful, stable, and useful. But it's syntax is very simple. 
It's kind of like all those other command line utilities that you have 
been using, yet it combines them in one place (with a standard, simple 
syntax). You can choose to just use it to do a simple recording, and 
then build to do more complex things. And it spits out enough info into 
the shell to let You know if You need to look towards the software or 
hardware end to figure out what's wrong. It's like a lot of things 
though. You have to get to know how to use it. But since it doesn't have 
a GUI, and it doesn't (require) Jack, you can eliminate a lot of other 
issues (for now).

Wait... now that I think of it... You originally mentioned using "lame" 
and "mpg123". Good news... ecasound uses "lame" and "mpg123" (along with 
other stable/powerful command line utilities) to get it's work done, yet 
you use ecasound's simple syntax, so I know you have parts of ecasound 
installed.


Yea... Keep it simple and build as you go...

It kinda looks like you don't have libgnomemm (Gnome--) 
installed, which is a C++ wrapper for Gnome and upon which 
gcdmaster is based.  I don't know how helpful it'll be, but 
here's the cdrdao spec file for the Mandrake RPM (gcdmaster is 
part of the stock 9.1 distribution, since it's built from the 
cdrdao source RPM):

http://www.kudla.org/cdrdao.spec

I'm guessing it's the libgnomemm thing though.

I do not have this line, but I doubt it matters.

I have a bit more stuff you don't. Maybe it will help, but I doubt it:

alias /dev/mixer snd-mixer-oss
alias /dev/dsp snd-pcm-oss
alias /dev/midi snd-seq-oss



OK, so that is sound coming from your application. You probably need to
route it to the outputs you want it to go to. This will be different
from my HDSP 9652, as per Jesse's instructions about where you are
supposed to route, but as a test, you should see audio (green or yellow)
on each output that has input in the middle row. It sounds like you are
not?


Sounds like the answer would be yes, but I'm not sure. How are you
getting the audio you see above if you are not using alsaplayer? Are you
using an Alsa or JAck app? Or are you using OSS emulation?
These results look good to me.

Lsmod and modules.conf do not show any problem to me.


You are most certainly playing a mono signal through the OSS emulation
layer. With hdspmixer preset 1, you should have signal coming out of all
the physical outputs, and also a VERY LOUD signal on the line outs, as all
the playback channels are routed to the line outs and thus summed up.
How is the card wired up ?
Do the meters show signal going through the outputs (3rd hdspmixer row) ?

As a side not, if you want to use alsaplayer with the alsa, you must use
the plughw interface :
alsaplayer -o alsa -d plughw:0


This looks good to me.

There is an argument for not using a general-purpose sound server when 
making music. Anecdote: a few years back, there was a song that got 
quite a bit of radio airplay that featured somewhere in the middle 
the sound effect on Windows for 'you've got mail'.  It used to annoy 
the hell out of people who listened to the radio while working on 
their computer, and the radio station I was listening to at the time 
got a few complaints.

So they decided to ask the musicians why this sound was on the record. 
The answer was that during the final mixdown, capturing the song to 
DAT tape or whatever, the person doing the mixdown had left the room 
for a minute - during that minute, some email arrived and the alert 
sound was played through the soundcard. The guy comes back into the 
room - the capture is done, and off goes the DAT to the CD pressing 
plant...

I've noticed a noise coming from mobile phone handsets - it must be a 
pretty powerful field, since it can also disrupt the display of a CRT

a slight ripple on the display, but a text message arrives on a phone 
and the display is all over the place...

And to think - people walk around with one of these clamped to the

subtle and complex electrical system if ever there was one!

I have figured this one out:
I had installed the alsaplayer package from debian unstable and changed
this to alsaplayer-alsa now. The message from alsaplayer has disappeared.
Sorry for the noise.


It was a *stereo* signal, as the meters show clearly different levels for
left and right channels. But no signal on any meters in the last row.

I don't know ;-)

I just run hdsploader a few times (until it gives no errors, which means
at least two times, sometimes three), start hdspmixer from alsa-tools 0.9.6
and then alsaplayer. I did *not* run amixer.  Do I get that right, that
hdspmixer replaces it and there is no need for amixer when I run hdspmixer?

With the *old* alsaplayer installation I got signals on all the meters of
the second row, all left channels showing same level, different from the
right channels.  All this channels where muted when starting up, but
un-muting them did *not* result in any signal showing up in the last row.

With the new alsaplayer-alsa installation and alsaplayer -o alsa -d plughw:0
I do not get the warning from the player any more. The first two channels
in the middle row show a stereo signal. Below that I see 'All 1+2' and
have tried to set this to different output channels...
Still no signal in the third row (faders are up), and still no sound...

No, I have tried many different things, including setting all channels to
mid-range and trying to set signal routing with amixer before starting
hdspmixer, but I have *never* seen a signal in the last row using Linux.
The card *does* work on 'another' OS, but this is not an option for me ;-)


BTW: Does firmware version still matter when I do use hdsploader?
     I baught the card very recently. How can I find out what firmware
     is on the card?

I think I could have made a very basic newbie mistake, even though I *did*
a lot of searching on the net, and did a lot of RTFM. I do not pretend
that I understood all of it, though.


Maybe this is wrong:
I do have installed jackd from Debian unstable, but I think did *not* start
it AFAIK.  'ps -A | grep jack' shows nothing. I wanted to proceed step
by step, but maybe this was the mistake?  How would I start jackd correctly
for my setup?  I had no luck so far with my attempts to do so, and wanted
to defer that.

Or another possibility:
I had tried both ways, installing ALSA from debian packages and installing
it from source. Maybe I did a mistake when trying to uninstall the self
compiled version (which did not work either) before I re-installed the
Debian packages?

I am currently reading the manual of RME and thinking about installing
the cvs ALSA version. Or maybe I should wipe out my disk and start again
with a new system... (oh, I would not like that too much ;-)

Thanks a lot for all the help I have got so far!
Robert Epprecht



-->><<--__-->><<--


OK, so this means that now a stereo signal is getting from alsaplayer into
the RME. For these meters to register at all the audio has to be in the
card, and it is, so that's good.

The fact that it's stereo now is a good sign.

If you have no meters on the last row, that is not good, but it doesn't
necessarily mean that the card will not produce audio. The green audio in
hdspmixer is read out of the card. If it's not being displayed, then one of
two things is happening:

1) Playback audio (wnd row) is not being routed to the outputs

2) hdspmixer is not reading the proper locations when trying to display t.

Either of these could be created by bad firmware. #1 could be caused by not
routing the audio manually.

You could try amixer commands by hand, like:

(Note - these are NOT the right ones for your hardware!!_

amixer cset numid=5 8,0,16000
amixer cset numid=5 9,1,16000

The numbers are typical bizarre Linux type numerical things. On my hardware,
with 26 inputs, I think it goes 0-25 are the 26 inputs, 26-51 are the 26
playbacks, and 0-25 are the outputs. The first command above routes input 8
to output 0 at a volume of 16000. (About 50%.)

You will need to discover your correct numbers. Try amixer for some clues,
although I still don't really understand what it tells me.


They both work (or can work) hand in hand. Do not use alsamixer.


It appears to me that the player is working correctly.

I think you've got this right, but just because the box says A1+A2 doesn't
mean it's routing audio if the fader is down. If the fader is up, then the
card should be routing audio.


This is Linux. If you're like me you'll be making newbie mistakes forever!
;-)

'ps -A | grep jack' shows nothing.

Jack is not running then, but it's not required.

I think you may have a firmware problem. Possibly with older firmware,
probably available from RME's web site, you will do better.

Good luck,
Mark





-->><<--__-->><<--

Bad idea. It should work the first time without errors or you can't 
trust it IMO.

I found similar errors to you until I decided to load the modules 
manually before running hdsploader.

I use a multiface here.

I run this script.

# modprobe snd-cmipci;
modprobe snd-mixer-oss;modprobe snd-pcm-oss; modprobe snd-seq-oss;
modprobe snd-hdsp; hdsploader;

# route jack inputs to line out
# left
amixer -c 1 cset numid=5 26,26,4000
amixer -c 1 cset numid=5 28,26,4000
amixer -c 1 cset numid=5 30,26,4000
amixer -c 1 cset numid=5 32,26,4000
# right
amixer -c 1 cset numid=5 27,27,4000
amixer -c 1 cset numid=5 29,27,4000
amixer -c 1 cset numid=5 31,27,4000
amixer -c 1 cset numid=5 33,27,4000

# Set volume for analog outputs to reasonable level
# and connect jack inputs to analog outs
amixer -c 1 cset numid=5 26,0,4000;
amixer -c 1 cset numid=5 27,1,4000;
amixer -c 1 cset numid=5 28,2,4000;
amixer -c 1 cset numid=5 29,3,4000;
amixer -c 1 cset numid=5 30,4,4000;
amixer -c 1 cset numid=5 31,5,4000;
amixer -c 1 cset numid=5 32,6,4000;
amixer -c 1 cset numid=5 33,7,4000;
amixer -c 1 cset numid=5 34,8,4000;

Save it as a file in your path eg /usr/local/bin/starthdsp

make it executable.

Hi!

I'm brazilian and I don't speak english. So... please... be patience :)

I have install jack 0.80 in one notebook Compaq presario 1200 with sound-card 
snd-via-82xxx(this module is from Alsa-Project).

All songs in my coputer play with no problems.

But when I try start jackd the system showme this error:

JACK compiled with System V SHM support
loading driver ..
creating alsa driver ... hw:0|hw:0|1024|2|48000|nomon|swmeter|rt
jackd: pcm.c:689: snd_pcm_nonblock: Assertion 'pcm' failed.
received signal 6 during shutdown (ignored)

I create all of directories of README.

And I put in fstab the lines:

none /mnt/ramfs tmpfs defaults 0 0
shmfs /dev/shm shm defaults 0 0

My kernel support shm and i can mount manually this directories.

I do this because before my last installation(compile) I use 
--enable-posix-shm

But in this time I remove all jack files os my system and killall -9 all 
process of jackd and recompile with stadard options.

The error is the same(but change the first line "with POSIX ..." for "with 
System V..."). Is OK.

So... my jack is compile with NO errors and the module of my sound card is ok.

The process of arts, esd, nas, etc, NOT exist in my process list(I use 
WindowMaker).

I have the directories(mounted) /mnt/ramfs and /dev/shm.

I don't have any sound aplications started(no one).

But I get the same error.

I create the /tmp/jack with permissions 777.

When i start jackd this directory is removed!!!!

What's this error? Somebody have some idea what is this?

I speak to Patrick Shirkey and I get much help, but my problem seems to be in 
my system.

Any help?

Thanks a lot!

OK, by default, with firmware loaded and no Alsa applications (hdspmixer,
amixer commands or anything else) doing anything, then my HDSP mixer does
the following routing: (I think!)

In1 + Playback1 == Out1
In2 + Playback2 == Out2
...
In 26 + Playback26 == Out26

So, I think you have fewer I/Os on this card, but I would be surprised if
RME did something very different on your MultiFace.


Maybe you should do what I did when Thomas and I couldn't get outputs
working. Instead of sending audio data out, concentrate on the inputs
instead. Send signals in, check what hdspmixer is displaying, and see if you
can record it to a wave file using something like Audacity or ReZound. You
may find that with your firmware things are off by 2 or 8 channels. Thomas
and I had this problem with the older HDSP 9652 driver. I switched to
debugging the inputs, and when we found the problems that led pretty quickly
to getting the outputs working.

Also, one input signal can get monitored very well in hdspmixer, but one
output signal requires you to check all outputs which is harder for you to
do.

Just an idea.


Yes, but if the driver doesn't match up with your firmware, then all you are
doing is controlling a piece of software, and then that software is not
correctly controlling your hardware.

Yes, I understand. There are other MultiFace users here. Maybe they can tell
you want firmware revisions they are running. what do you see with an lspci
or lspci -vv command?

Don't run Jack yet would be my input. Until you can get some audio out
somewhere it's just more work and it's not required.


I think you would

1) Run hdsploader to get the card configured
2) Run the script to set the levels in the configured card
3) Run alsaplayer, or jack and then alsaplayer -o jack to send the audio to
a card which is configured and set up.

Again, Jack is not required to make this work. If it won't work without
Jack, then it won't work with Jack. There's a more basic problem here.
(Probably firmware.)


I'm still trying to get to the point where I can give something back! ;-)

Can anyone recommend a simple pd patch that wont take too much CPU, runs
happiily in jack and takes a pair of streams does something noticable and
outputs a pair of streams?

The examples I tried generally dont do straight processing.

I should be able to make one myself really, but I dont have pd-fu :(

RRRRRR!!!! Blaaarrrrgghhh!!!

No way. My process list is empty of any sound applications.

Maybe some problem with my modules snd.

But... what problem?!!

Thanks for your help. If this error is a "lock" device, so... maybe problem 
with load my modules.

But I can't load manually the default module for VIA82xxx of Slackware. After 
installation the Alsa-driver the only module can be loaded is the 
snd-via82xx(the module of Alsa).

For this things I believe now In one error in my system modules.

Thanks!

I will try change some configurations in my system. Maybe the fact of my

I get that you're not going to run jack right now, but later, if you want
to, do:

(As a user)

jackd -d alsa -d hw

to just run it. Try:

jackd -v -d alsa -d hw

to get lots of messages about what it's doing. As root try:

jackd -v -R -d alsa - d hw

to run Jack with realtime capabilities and messages.

man jackd will tell you all this and more.

Signal number 6 is SIGABRT.

SIGABRT is the signal that an application sends itself if it wants to
exit with a core dump.  This is mostly used for debugging - so I'm
guessing jackd found some strange condition and decided to dump core so
the problem could be debugged.

To me, it looks like you probably need to ask on the jack mailing list,
which you can find at http://jackit.sourceforge.net/lists/

No, it should be like that - Slackware doesn't come with ALSA, only with
the OSS drivers, and you definitely want to be using the snd-via82xx
from ALSA.

I know. Slackware have the module via82cxxx_audio

But much aplications need the alsa drivers.

So... i compile the alsa module and use this.

After compilation of Alsa modules I need to load the snd-via82xx

The module standard of slackware doesn't work because changes in the 
dependencies(i think so).

was trying out this and that, (but had *not* used any amixer commands

When I plugged in a sound source the input meter *did* show the signal.
I have no idea, why the signal is shown now, and never was before.
(I had tried a few times before).  Very confusing.

I was not able to get an output signal, whether on the output jacks
nor displayed by the meters.  Of course I have tried to set routing,
faders and un-muting, but had no success.

While the higher number (analog) inputs still showed -infinity they
changed to display the noise floor as soon I had plugged a cable to
the inputs, and continued to do so, even when I unplugged the cable.
Under 'another' OS I have seen them behave like this, so I think
this is normal (I don't remember having seen -infinity there, only
the noise floor, but this could be an accident).

I'll try to find out under what conditions the signal starts to show
up and will report what I find...

-->><<--__-->><<--

-infinity means 'all zeros'. When you plug in an external device you begin
to see its 'noise floor'. For instance, on my ADAT inputs, if I hook one to
an AI-3 which has a spec'ed noise floor of -98db I see the inputs register
about -99db to -101db, much as you would expect. However, if I hook an ADAT
input to my Pro Tools rig and its ADAT outputs I still register -infinity
since Pro Tools sends 'all zeros' on ADAT outputs that are not being used.
Makes sense..


This is disappointing. Did you do the lspci -v and get the info on your
firmware revision?


In your case the MultiFace has internal A/D converters, correct? In this
case I do not know why it should change either.

As an experiment you might try a clean boot, open hdspmixer and hdspconf,
and then change some clock settings in hdspconf. Maybe that will wake it up
and get it to display things correctly?

Or possibly even though the MultiFace has A/D's they are not hooked up
initially and stay that way until you plug something in? Just a thought.

Hmm I tried to test, but realised that it will take me some more

I thought I had them disabled, but lsmod proved me wrong...

So I tried a simple quick test, which I think should (could?) have
the same effect:  I manually unloaded the modules in question after
booting, checked with lsmod and then and run your script adapted to
my card#. I even did try to unplug the Multiface cable in between on
some of my tests, just to try everything I could imagine could possibly
help). But hdsploader returned with the same error message as it always
does when I start it the first time.

Running the routing and level setting part of the script after running
hdsploader again did not solve the problems either.


Do you think it could make a difference when the modules have been
loaded already on boot up, but removed later on?

Maybe you know this already, but debian doesn't use /etc/modules.conf as
other distros. Look instead in /etc/modutils/, there should be a file
called alsa. After any change to this file run update-modules.

Hallo,


Attached is a simple one. erode.pd is the main patch, should be
pretty self-explanatory, but nevertheless: 

[adc~] is audio-in, [ezdac~] is a wrapper around audio-out and
[erosion~] is a simple modulation effect, that sends the signal
through a variable lenghth delay line, where the delay time is
modulated by either a sine wave or bandpass filtered noise. It is
modeled after the Erosion effect in Ableton Live and is quite an "in
ya face" effect, good for demoing, IMO.

That's good to know it's consistent. Sounds like a firmware bug to me 
too now. One other thing which you may not have tried is booting m$ then 
warmbooting into linux (don't turn off the machine between boots). I 
just remembered that with older versions ofthe driver this was the only 
way to get the multiface to work.

I can't remember if you are running cvs or not (probably no).


They shouldn't as long as you remove them before running hdsploader :)

Please tell us what firmware you are running.  An lspci -v will
give a listing and a (rev ??) will be part of the rme hammerfall
entry.  For instance, I have rev 0b which has been well supported
and working great now for several months (cardbus/multiface).

The M-Audio MobilePre/Sonica/Transit/Ozone devices need a firmware
download before they can be used with Linux.

I've released a first beta of the madfu-firmware package which tries
to accomplish this.

Please note that I do not have any of these devices, and that the
loader is not tested at all. That's why I'm searching for volunteers.
:-)

To download the beta, go to
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=87777&release_id=183375

When running Frank's exmaple pd patch (and all the others I've tried)
under JACK, using the Planet CCRMA version of pd I get lots of IO Errors
reported by pd, even though there doesnt seem to be any dropouts, the cpu
load is low and jack doesnt report any xruns.

Is there a .pdrc file or something where I can set the block size to make
it match jacks? Or is there something else wrong?

OK, in this case, if I remember Jesse's post last evening, you have
older firmware. Wasn't he running rev 0b?

If so I think you need to upgrade your firmware.

The problem was my firmware version. I had version 10 and have upgraded
to version 11.  Now everything I have tested so far works like expected!


Some important steps that I had missed on the path of setting up a
RME Hammerfall DSP card (in my case a PCI interface and a multiface)
on a Linux box using ALSA:

* You can determine the firmware version by doing 'lspci -vv'

* Firmware version 10 (0a) did not work for me,
  version 11 (0b) seems to run fine as far as I can tell by now.
  (This version is the current version on the RME webside).

* If you use the snd-hdsp module you have to call hdsploader from alsa-tools
  after loading the module.

* Things like un-muting, setting channel levels and channel routing is done
  in hdspmixer from alsa-tools.

* Settings like Clock sync, sample rate and type of SPDIF in/out are set
  by the program called 'hdspconf'.

It looks to me like a good place to put this info is in the "user notes" 
attached to the ALSA sound card matrix:
 visit http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/
 find matrix line for your card, click "details"
 click "user contributed notes"
 click "ADD".

Sure I could do it myself but it's not my info, I don't even have this kind of 
sound card. 

There is also a WIKI for ALSA soundcard HOWTOs at

Both of these are out of date. I tried to submit updates to the ALSA 
matrix, but it appears to be unmaintained. The SuSE hardware database 
is no better - I was surprised to see this was also out of date, 
given that SuSE is offering a commercial distribution based on ALSA.

I'm afraid it doesn't reflect very well on the LAU community that all 
these docs are out of date. I know it's a boring job, but it's so 
important to have reliable hardware compatibility information. Is 
there no way we could combine the best parts of the matrix and the 
wiki to make a new, definitive and official document?  
 
Cheers

Hi
According to the responses to my previous post. There does not seem to be 
a way in linux to send MIDI command from my shell to a MIDI output 
interface. 

The closest response I got was to use a MIDI controller (keyboard) press 
the note and then pull the keyboard cable so it cannot send a stop (it 
works but, I do believe there is a better way in linux).

For reference I want to be able to generate drone tones on my MIDI. I am 
looking for a simple application (MIDI shell??) that would let me turn a 
particular note on. I already have a sound card with the wavetable, this 
sound card understands midi. Alsa is supposed to have a good midi api, so 
how so I insert a midi event into my souncards midi output interface!!
FT




-->><<--__-->><<--



FT/mawali,
   Since the last time we spoke about this I have been using a new Linux
application called Drums++. It's really a small programming language for
generating drum patterns. It runs in a shell and creates a MIDI file, or
will play the patterns you write real-time. It's simple and easy to try out.

   One aspect of an early version of the program was that it generated MIDI
note on events, but did not generate note off events. It strikes me that
possibly this would work for you. For me, I have asked Mike to generate
limited time MIDI events as they work better in notation programs, but
possibly this could become a command line option and it would work for both
of us.

   Mike has been pretty interactive with me and is interested in getting
people to use his app. It's a cool little app as far as it goes. I think it
might be useful for you. Check it out if it sounds interesting.

So far it seems like definitive, official, up-to-date documentation is one of 
the things that a conventional business structure does a lot better than the 
bazar. Surely there must be a business case for computer sound interface 
makers to invest something in maintaining useful HOWTOs for their products 
used with Linux. Meanwhile, it seems like a WIKI is a good technology for 
preserving  and making findable the results of problem-solving discussions on 
the newsgroup. WIKIs and forums (fora?) have been set up, but draw little 
content. Why not?



Are you saying that the "Add comment" button on 
http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/ just dumps the comments into a black 
hole? How sad. I do see what claims to be a user comment from as recently as 
june 2003 on the Hammerfall DSP page.

As for the matrix itself, I wonder how long it will be before alsa-project 
notices that Midiman changed their name to M-Audio years ago. Jeepers!

Hallo,


There is "-blocksize <n>   -- specify audio I/O block size in sample
frames", maybe that helps. Another thing to try is running Pd with
"-realtime" for higher scheduling. You need to do a "chmod +s
/usr/bin/pd" then. 

My patch should use a only minimal amount of CPU, it's a really cheap
one. Maybe running Pd 0.37, compiled from source works better. It
might be that Pd 0.36 handles jack 0.80 not correctly. If you try 0.37
be sure to use the CVS version from pure-data.sf.net (or use the
Debian source package [1] from unstable, which is provided by Guenther
Geiger who also does the Jack support in Pd and should be based on the
CVS version)

Hallo,


Well, Pd (Pure Data) is a modular softsynth, that treats midi note
message simply as lists or pairs of note/velocity values. As a
note-off normally is just a note with velocity 0 cou could just omit
this. I attached a simple example patch for Pd that just sends a 
[60 100( note on message (which is a "C" with a decent velocity). If
you don't want Pd to open this window you could use 
"pd -nogui drone-c.pd" once to make a drone directly from the shell. 

There are also ways to remote control Pd over network but this might
be off-topic now.

Hi,
Why not try Midge, a text-to-midi converter?
http://www.dmriley.demon.co.uk/code/midge/

One of the many features of Midge's own small language is the ability to
generate note-on/off events at a given time in a midi file. From here I
see two approaches you might choose:
1) You might create a midi file containing timed note-on/off events to
suite your needs. (This would be a non-interactive approach)
2) You might create two files, one containing a single, immediate
note-on event and another containing its note-off counterpart and play
them whenever you want to trigger the desired event. (That would be the
interactive approach)

I must add, however, that I have never tried this myself and cannot
guarantee that it will work properly once put to the test; I just
thought that it might be worth trying.

Hope this helps,
S.M.

Hi there.  Does anybody have a step by step on how to get a little =

audio stuff.  things are working to some degree (except I haven't been =
able to record yet - but I'll wait to ask about that, when my real sound =
card comes :) )

I haven't got a clue, basically.  I'm pretty new.  When I wanted a midi =
interface to work in Cakewalk for DOS (that's right, that's what I was =
using last) I just downloaded the driver, and copied the driver into a =
file called driver.something  -  this apparently is not quite that =
simple?  (I have read the planet ccrma how to on usb interfaces - so far =
nothing, and I was afraid the apt-get hotplug thing would flash firmware =
onto my steinberg that wouldn't be right, considering the steinberg =
isn't listed on their hardware list...

am I even remotely understandable???

thanks in advance! *laugh*

You can generate a note-on event from bash, with something like this:
echo -n $'\x90\x45\x70' > /dev/midi01

The above command plays the A note on "/dev/midi01" 
x90 is the MIDI note-on status byte
x45 = decimal 69 = A (440 Hz).
x70 is the note velocity

If you want to stop the sound, use:
echo -n $'\x80\x45\x70' > /dev/midi01
where x80 is the note-off status byte.


You need to discover which /dev/midiXX is your soundcard wavetable synth. 
If you prefer to use ALSA rawmidi devices, replace /dev/midiXX with 
/dev/snd/midiCxDy, where "x" is the card number and "y" is a device number 
belonging to this card.

Pedro

I would try blowing up a paper bag, and recording the
sound of bursting it between your hands.  Then,
slow the sound down by a factor which should be in
accordance to the desired size of the explosion.

Tobiah




-->><<--__-->><<--


I remember reading something about the audio
production for a tornado sound for some Hollywood
movie. They used around 180 tracks which included,
cows, car crashes, breaking glass, etc. 

I've never done this type of sound design.

With Tobiah's paper bag idea, you can make many copies
and apply different reverb settings as needed. Perhaps
you'll need one track with a long reverb delay and no
tail which might create the initial Bang and secondary
boom. And another with a huge reverb room, and long
tail to create the impression of a sound wave that's
traveling many miles. With numerous tracks you'll be
able to mix the level of the different effect results.

Hi,
   Is anyone else experiencing this problem? I set up a bunch of
aconnect commands to route my keyboard controller (64:0) to a number of
synths on different MIDI interfaces, and also to route the output of Pro
Tools (on another computer) to pretty much the same places:

aconnect 64:0 64:32
aconnect 64:0 80:1
aconnect 80:0 64:0
aconnect 80:0 64:32
aconnect 80:0 80:1

I also route Pro Tools output back to my keyboard (line 3) in case I
want to plug another hardware synth in there, but nothing is hooked up
to that right now.

At this point I set up my mixer and play. Everything works and is
perfectly fine for long periods of time.

I then start Jack and within a minute or two I lose MIDI connectivity. I
can run alsaplayer or other audio apps and I still get audio, but there
is no more MIDI connectivity. I look at the synths and they are not
receiving MIDI input. (No event lights.)

I then stop Jack and I immediately hear a bunch of MIDI notes get
played.These notes were stored from when I wasn't getting connectivity.
At this point I have MIDI back for live playing until the next time I
start Jack when it happens again.

I do this 4 or 5 times and at this point I cannot get MIDI back at all.
I have to completely power down as far as I can tell. I tried rebooting
and had no luck the one time I did that.

I don't know what to look at to figure out what could be causing this.
Hardware and modules shown below.

Thanks,
Mark

hotplug is so that your system can communicate with USB devices. If you 
already have a usb device that is working you don't need to install it.

You should try using hte usb-audio driver and report what you get with
	
	cat /proc/asound/devices
or	cat /proc/asound/cards

If it is standards complient it should work out of the box. If it needs 
firmware then Clemens Ladisch is your best bet. But he may be busy.

The matrix is not unmaintained. I lost my main workstation a couple of 
months ago and have been trying to get it back since. It is not an easy 
task or cheap and I haven't the space on this machine or the inclination 
to install apache and mysql.

Unfortunately that is how it goes when people volunteer to help on a 
large project like the alsa website.

If I was paid and had someone else to maintain my gear then there 
wouldn't be a problem.

The alsa website is the definitive document. If you find stuff in the 
wiki that you think should be in the website you can submit it. But 
until I get a new video card and rescue all the info on my failed HDD it 
won't be incorporated into the site.

Hopefully I haven't lost everything that people submitted to me before 
the crash. Currently the prognosis is grim though.

On top of all that I also have to recode the backend as Jaroslav 
recently upgraded to php4.

Plus I'm having more fun making music at the moment.

It took me at least a year to get it to where it is now. I am not going 
to ditch that effort, just out of action for a while.

Reading about sound effects of this kind made me think of a story
I heard about how the band Yello generated the thunder and lightning
sound at the start of the song that was part of the soundtrack to 
the movie "Ferris Bueler's Day Off".

Apparently it was done by recording the unwrapping of one of those
large reels of cellotape. The recording was then slowed donw to
give a realy nice thunder.

My experience was this: Some time ago, I saw the Midiman DMAN PCI was 
listed as untested. I bought one of these cards and did quite a bit 
of testing, then posted the results to alsa-devel as it says at the 
top of the matrix that this is the proper place to send corrections. 
Summary: playback worked, recording didn't (at the time).

To this day the card is still listed as untested. I appreciate that 
it's a lot of work for a volunteer, and I don't mean to criticise you 
personally. It's just with ALSA going into the mainstream kernel this 
matrix is a really crucial document, and the information that exists 
in the community is not being incorporated into it.   

I think there's a strong case for one of the Linux distributors to pay 
someone to maintain this information. At the moment, it seems none of 
them could answer the question 'will my soundcard work?', since they 
all appear to refer back to the ALSA site.

Cheers

Yes, using concrete sounds and editing them is often better and easier
then synthesizing...

(Just googled on this, I remembered correctly:)

"The T-Rex dinosaur sounds in the film [Jurassic Park] were developed
from a combination of elephants, alligators, penguins, tigers and dogs."

I especially like the use of penguins ;-)

Maarten



-->><<--__-->><<--

No, just that it's not possible for users to edit the main matrix with 
the most important information - ie, does the card work or not?

It might also be useful to have a sort of 'gold star' so that people 
who are looking to buy a soundcard to use with Linux have an idea 
which are the best supported, according to existing users. You could 
break this down by category in order to answer questions such as 
'what are the best USB audio devices?' or 'what is the best ADAT 
interface?'. This could be linked through to third-party sales 
websites, which could generate some revenue to pay someone to 
maintain the document.


I think for a while they still used the Midiman name specifically for 
MIDI products - maybe they stil do. But people will be looking for 
M-Audio in the matrix, it's true.
 
Cheers

Daniel



-->><<--__-->><<--
 
I could be wrong, but I thought that the Midiman brand name was retained
for the more consumer-oriented products, M-Audio for those aimed at the
professional market.

Hi!

Finaly I can run jackd and compile Adour.

But I can't run Ardour. I can see the splash screen, but Ardour killing 
itself.

So:

# ardour

Ardour/GTK 0.380.1 running with libardour 0.686.3
Loading UI configuration file /usr/local/ardour/ardour_ui.rc
Loading system configuration file /usr/local/etc/ardour/ardour_system.rc
Loading user configuration file /usr/local/etc/ardour/ardour.rc
ardour: [WARNING]: MMC MIDI port "trident" not available: no MMC control 
possible
343: received signal 4
ardour is killing itself for a clean exit
Killed


I don't get Ardour using CVS because I can't connect the cvsroot.

So, I get the file ardour_current-cvs.tar in the website of Ardour.

What is MIDI port "trident"? I haven't hardware trident, any, in my computer.

The TODO file say: "don't initiate MIDI binding if there is no MMC control".

Is it my answer?

But where I disable "MIDI binding"?

I don't make any change in the files *.rc

But after this error I remove any line about MMC or MIDI and I get the same 
error.

Somebody can help me?

Thanks!

Hi,


Paul uses the settings for his hardware and
installation in the default ardour.rc file.


I'd say yes.


In the ardour.rc file.


You've probably got more than one ardour.rc file.
Perhaps a system wide and one for normaluser. If
you're editing ~/normaluser/ardour/.ardour.rc and
getting the above message it's because you're starting
ardour from the system wide ardour.rc.

Incidentally, there are ardour mailing lists.

Hi Alexander
you should post how you start jackd and post the output, too,
i'll make things easier for people to help you. 
I doubt your problem has anything to do with the warning about the midi
setting.

regards.

Hmm.  I definitely don't have any working USB devices - this is the first
USB device I'm trying to bring online.  I read that the Steinberg DOES need
firmware, but I have yet to find any - Clemens Ladisch, you say?

I will mess around with usb-audio driver and such tonight...

thanks, I'll let ya know what I find...












-->><<--__-->><<--

I forgot to mention on the website that the Steinberg USB-2-MIDI ist
just a relabeled MidiSport 2x2. Please try the midisport_firmware
package from <http://usb-midi-fw.sf.net/>.


Regards,
Clemens

Thank you much!!

I have it working now.  For other people's reference, here's what I did:

download from http://usb-midi-fw.sf.net/ and follow directions in readme
(which includes getting the win2000 drivers)
then I unplugged the interface from the usb cable, and plugged it back in.
after that I was in business.  I'm not sure, but I MIGHT have been in
business before that.

before this email strain I had tried the how-to at
http://ccrma-www.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/usbmidi.html but after
doing that, my interface didn't show up AND my machine was hanging all over
the place, so I downloaded the rpms instead of using apt-get, that didn't
work, so I changed the two configs mentioned back and did an rpm -e to
uninstall ezusbmidi.  THEN I tried the usb-midi-fw.sf.net site

whoa.  I just thought that what if I had unplugged and plugged in the
interface after the ccrma how-to?  anybody have any thoughts on this?

also what I'm unclear about is if I hadn't done the planet ccrma how-to,
would I have had hotplugs installed, and would this have made a difference
when I was installing the firmware from http://usb-midi-fw.sf.net/?


anyway this phase is accomplished - thanks for your input :)

now my question for all y'all is, are there any sequencer packages for linux
that will sync to Midi Time Code (not MIDI clock, but actual MIDI time
code)?  it occurs to me that making, for example, Rosegarden slave to Jack,
might do it, because Jack might sync to actual MIDI time code.  but I
haven't figured that out yet.  anyone know?  (the main sequencer I've been
trying right now is Rosegarden 4) :)

Everything looks good, perhaps there is a kernel/alsa mismatch?

The alsa-driver/kernel rpm is version specific and must match your
kernel.  The ALSA freshrpms are compiled for the most recent offical
redhat kernel, 2.4.20 something.  Take a look at the alsa-kernel rpm
installed from fresh and see if it matches:

I think that's the general idea, but there used to be Midiman audio 
cards (eg the DMAN PCI) and now there are M-Audio cards which have 
MIDI (such as the Delta series). So there is scope for confusion...
 
Cheers

-->><<--__-->><<--


 Why's that?

 They have firewire interfaces now... USB. It's just evolution.
 At one point in time they had 2 different companies that made
 what was, at the time, 2 different products. Their cards have 
 evolved to incorporate aspects of both products. {Sort of
 inevitable given that the functionality of either is often times
 dependent on the other.}

 I imagine their bookeepers are having a hard time with it but I
 really don't see the need for the rest of us to suffer. :}

 I'm waiting for them to partner with intel and offer us audio
 and multimedia motherboards.

The original point was that the ALSA matrix only mentions Midiman, not 
M-Audio.

Greetings all!  I am attempting to initiate a long unattended 2-channel
audio recording - perhaps lasting for an hour or two - but I am prevented
from doing so by periodic overruns which occur at regular intervals.  This
interval changes according to my system configuration.  Currently, I
consistently get an overrun about 20 minutes after I start recording.

My system is an AMD Athlon XP 1700+ with 256mb DDR266 memory.  Video card is
an ATI Radeon 7500/64mb.  Sound card is an M-Audio Audiophile 2496.  I'm
running Slackware 9.0.  My kernel version is 2.6.test5.  Prior to this
kernel I was using 2.4.21 with low-latency and preemptible kernel patches -
with exactly the same overrun issue.  I'm using jackd version 0.79.2,
Ardour/GTK 0.378.0, and libardour 0.686.0 (all built from CVS source a few
weeks ago.)  I'm starting jackd with the command:

jackd -v -a -R -d alsa -d ice1712 -r 44100 -p 2048

I don't want to clog everyone's mailbox with an even bigger message, so I've
posted a bit of additional info online.

Results from running latancytest0.42-png:
http://www.comevisit.com/NorthernSunrise/latency/3x256.html
http://www.comevisit.com/NorthernSunrise/latency/test2/3x256.html

http://www.comevisit.com/NorthernSunrise/latency/.config

My jack, and ardour version numbers, and hdparm info for hda and hdb:
http://www.comevisit.com/NorthernSunrise/latency/configuration

I can see from the latency tests that *something* is causing spikes,
particularly during disk write, but I'm not sure how to determine precisely
what it is.  Is there any way to obtain a snapshot of processor usage at the
exact moment of an overrun?  Any help or advice (or reminders about what
info I've neglected to give) would be very much appreciated!

If you're not already doing it, use reiserfs or xfs.  From your pictures
it looks like you might be using ext3.  There are a few processes that
should be dead before you start doing realtime.  I use a script with the
following:

killall -9 autorun 2>/dev/null
killall -9 artsd 2>/dev/null
killall -9 jackd 2>/dev/null
rm -rf /tmp/jack*
killall -9 /usr/lib/ardour/ardourx 2>/dev/null
killall -9 oafd 2>/dev/null
killall -9 xbiff 2>/dev/null
killall -9 envy24control 2>/dev/null
killall -9 /usr/bin/aplay 2>/dev/null

I'm using almost the same hardware setup as you and I hardly ever get
overruns (1700+ and ST Audio DSP2000 C-Port).  One thing that did give
me problems was using IO_support set to 3.  The sync seemed to give me
problems.  I set both of mine to 1 (no sync).  I also kicked up to 512
MB of memory from 256 and that helped some too.  You can see what I've
done to my system at
http://myweb.cableone.net/eviltwin69/ALSA_JACK_ARDOUR.html

-->><<--__-->><<--

Nope - I'm using reiserfs.  However, I do know for a fact that I was running
envy24control when I got the overruns.  I'll make sure it's dead next time.


I'll look into this - thanks again!


Actually, I went through this entire document a few weeks ago.  I already
owe you a tremendous debt of gratitude for putting it together.  It was
exactly what I needed in order to get started with serious Linux audio.
I'll take another look, though, in case I neglected something.

Thanks again!

"The trouble with computers, of course, is that they're very sophisticated

-->><<--__-->><<--

Pretty interesting. Does it really seem to come after 20 minutes from
when recording started? Or is one maybe happening every 20 minutes?

I do not remember anyone bringing anything like this up before.




The 5 second interval on the disk copy stress test would be the journal
file getting written, I think. The location of the journal file is at a
different place on the disk than the sequential data you're writing, so
the disk head has to seek for that location, causing a bit of delay.
It's not particularly bad.

The one time 4mS spike is anybodies guess at this point. Maybe you want
to look very carefully at every process that's running to see if any of
them would use your audio drive. While you showed hda and hdb, normally
that would be two drives on the same IDE cable. If this is how you are
set up, and presuming that hda is the system and hdb is a second hard
drive for audio, then I would consider putting the second hard drive on
a separate IDE cable. If you are recording to your system drive, then
this spike could be kernel related, or anything else that's mysterious.
;-)


lspci 
cat /proc/interrupts

Just more general info on the hardware you are using.

BTW - MY opinion is that unless you are doing recording and playback
together, you should not bother recording with such a low latency
setting. There is no advantage in getting the audio to disk in 3mS vs.
10mS when you are just recording. Even though my system can do 1.2mS And
seems to work, I never use it. Back off on the buffer size and let the
system breath a bit.

Good luck,
Mark

[Note - I accidentally sent a copy of this message from another e-mail
address.  I'm sending this copy since I don't expect the first to show up.
Sorry for the double-post if I am mistaken in my expectation.]



I haven't double-checked with my current configuration (I will do so and
confirm) but I did test this with an earlier configuration, and waiting an
arbitrary length of time before initiating recording didn't affect the
length of time before the overrun.

I'm beginning to wonder whether this is related to disk-caching.  My theory
would be:

1. System begins recording with an empty cache
2. Cache fills with audio data
3. System flushes cache, attempting to write too much data at once
4. Overrun caused
5. Recording stops
6. Back to 1

This would explain the consistent timing of the overrun, and would
potentially explain the 4 ms spike showing up at exactly the same spot in
both latency tests.

I'm certainly a newcomer to Linux audio configuration, but I do know that
Pro Tools users under MacOS 9 were told to reduce disk cache size.  I can't
remember what the recommended size was - somewhere between 256k and 512k
IIRC - but problems would appear if the cache was either too big or too
small.  I'll be googling for info on Linux disk cache settings as soon as I
send this message.


hda is Linux, hdb is Windows.  I shouldn't have even bothered with specs for
hdb.  Sorry for complicating the diagnostic process.

"The trouble with computers, of course, is that they're very sophisticated

Interesting situation. Should be interesting to see what you find out.

Very possibly.


Welcome! I'm a Pro Tools user under Windows. On the Windows side we have
not had these warnings about reducing disk cache, as far as I can
remember...


Forgiven. No problem. However, this means you are doing latency testing
to your system drive. Is this correct? You do not have a second,
separate audio drive at this point? I ask as I notice you have the
Promise ATA controller on IRQ11.

Also, maybe I forgot, but what windowing environment are you running?
KDE? Gnome? I run fluxbox and think it's quite nice for audio, if you
like minimalistic environments. I raise this question as I had a lot fo
similar problems with KDE, and never tried Gnome after I got fluxbox
working well. (And it's very easy to try out without effecting what ever
your other environment is.)

OK, one potential problem I spot is the IRQ for your audio controller is
about the worst it could have at IRQ5. As a Mac guy you are forgiven if
you don't realize how screwed up Intel architecture interrupts are. The
non-APIC IRQ priority order goes:

0,1,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,3,4,5,6,7

so at 5 your audio card is 'behind' nearly everything else in the
system. Normally you want to try and get it on IRQ 9, 10 or 11.

Actually, since you have the Promise on IRQ11, you'd be in fat city with
an audio drive attached to it and the sound card on IRQ9 or 10, or at
least that's been my experience.

(Strange that the Promise is there in lspci but doesn't show up in
/proc/interrupts. Maybe some more knowledgeable Linux person could help
me understand why. I don't know...



Hey, go for it if you can get it to work. By the time you get down to
this level of operation these machines are a bit of art and black magic.
I work on chips that go into PCs fpr a living, so I'm cool with it, but
it drives me nuts sometimes, so don't think you're alone! ;-)


My pleasure, for what it's worth.

-->><<--__-->><<--
Benji,

	I'm just killing envy24control to make sure it's dead before I crank up
another iteration of it.  I normally have it running all the time.  It
could be the IO_support thing.  That gave me the same type of problems.

Jan






-->><<--__-->><<--
You go Mark!!!  I didn't even spot the IRQ thing.

Jan







-->><<--__-->><<--

I'm glad to meet you.  I've been playing with Pro Tools since 4.3.1, and my
studio is running currently running MIX plus on an old beige G3/300 running
MacOS 9.  I've often wanted to migrate over to Windows, but we'd lose all of
our plug-ins.  Pro Tools is actually one of my biggest motives for moving to
Linux - one gets tired of jumping through flaming hoops every time
DigiDesign or Apple release new hardware or software.


Well...I *do* have a third drive hooked up to the Promise controller, but
upon installing it, I discovered that my power supply doesn't want to supply
power to another drive - even though I have enough power hookups.  I can
only use the drive if I disconnect power from my LS120, CD-ROM or Windows
hard drive.  Time to buy a new power supply....


I'm running Blackbox - we seem to be cousins.

For what it's worth, I've also posted my XF86Config:
http://www.comevisit.com/NorthernSunrise/latency/XF86Config
It has a few things I need to fix, but nothing that I think would affect
audio performance.


My machine is absolutely adamant that the sound card *has* to go there :(  I
spent many frustrating and fruitless hours trying to address this issue.  I
sifted through every single BIOS setting, juggled the cards all over the
place, but the only way I could get the card off IRQ 5 was by disabling that
IRQ.  When I did this, it moved the card up to IRQ 4, and so on.  In short,
my machine *always* gives the sound card the lowest-priority IRQ, and
provides no way (that I could find) to assign IRQs manually.  Ultimately, I
put things back as they were, and decided to be more careful next time I buy
a board.

I *might* be able to force it to share an IRQ with something else.  Would
this be worth tampering with?


Since I wasn't ready to use it, I don't think I built drivers for it when I
built the kernel.  Might this explain the discrepancy?

Also, I've done quite a bit of scouring around for information on disk cache
settings.  Mostly, what I find are messages asking how to set a maximum disk
cache size, followed by silence, or by replies saying not to bother with it.
Often the discussion quickly descends into a debate about the soundness of
Linux's VM system, with the original question about the disk cache system
being ignored.  I did find a patch by Rik van Riel
(http://surriel.com/patches/2.4/2.4.20-rmap15c) which appears to provide
sysctl parameters for cache size restraints, but I'd have to download and
build a 2.4.20 kernel, downgrade my module utilities, etc.

Even if something else is causing my overruns now, I certainly suspect that
real-time performance could be enhanced by a bit of cache settings tweaking.
If anyone has any info on doing this with a 2.6.test5 kernel, I would love
to get it.  My curiosity has been awakened :)

Thanks again for the continued help!

that
tweaking.

I ought to be in bed right now, but I did manage to find what I was looking
for.  The values I want to adjust are in /proc/sys/vm/.  Some basic
observations about the effects of different cache settings on I/O
performance can be found at:

http://drscriptt.riverviewtech.net/linux/enotes/bdflush.html

I also found a page with some other potentially useful information for
tracking down hard disk I/O operations (although the goal of the document is
quite unrelated to audio streaming):

http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~mukesh/hacks/spindown/t1.html

Lastly, I changed the IO_support setting to 1, and Ardour has now been
happily recording for an hour and a half!  I was also able to run the
latency test without overruns (the 4 ms. spike dropped to 2.7 ms.).  Thanks
so much for your help, Mark & Jan!

I'll be looking into the disk caching parameters, and if I come up with any
promising results, I'll certainly post my findings.

 I spent some time earlier this evening looking at some of their cards.
 Figure at some time in your process you're going to have to deal with
 it anyway. {Their cables cost as much as my sound card.}

 I'm harboring this secret hope that Avid's going to port the SGI version
 of DV Xpress to linux {and that as a result linux's rep as a multimedia
 platform will improve by leaps and bounds.} someday soon. 


 Maybe a dedicated video/audio editing workstation with a Blender/Combustion
 style interface done in SDL? It would be a great way to harness all of those
 command line audio programs.

This sequence can be simplified and made a little more safe.

a) use "--quiet" instead of "2>/dev/null", so that any failure to run
   killall is not hidden, yet it won't complain if there are no 
   processes with that name,

b) use "--signal KILL" instead of "-9", to ease later understanding,

c) use "--wait" as well, so that potential timing issues are excluded
   (if you did the sequence of killall's at higher priority than the
   processes you have killed, then it is theoretically possible for you
   to start new processes before the processes you killed have actually
   died, and these new processes may therefore not run as expected ...
   the technical term is "race condition".)

d) test for and use just the default SIGTERM signal, as there are some
   programs that need to undo some of the work they have done, and a
   SIGKILL (the -9) allows them no chance to do so.  (An example are
   programs that create permanent shared memory segments or other IPC
   arcania; and then only delete them properly if not SIGKILLed.)

   A rule of thumb is to prove to yourself that SIGTERM doesn't work
   before adopting SIGKILL.

e) place the commands in a file in /usr/local/bin or $HOME/bin, include 
   that directory in your PATH, make sure the file is executable 
   "chmod +x killit", and add a "set -v", so that when you run it you can
   immediately see it's progress.  If you've never written a file 
   containing commands to execute, have a go, you'll love the idea.

#!/bin/sh
set -v
killall --quiet --wait --signal KILL autorun
killall --quiet --wait --signal KILL artsd
killall --quiet --wait --signal KILL jackd
rm -rf /tmp/jack*
killall --quiet --wait --signal KILL /usr/lib/ardour/ardourx
killall --quiet --wait --signal KILL oafd
killall --quiet --wait --signal KILL xbiff
killall --quiet --wait --signal KILL envy24control
killall --quiet --wait --signal KILL /usr/bin/aplay

f) and to really go all the way, do some "factoring" to make it easier 
   to add new programs ... although this is no use if programs need 
   different signals:

#!/bin/sh
set -x
for PROCESS in autorun artsd jackd /usr/lib/ardour/ardourx oafd \
               xbiff envy24control /usr/bin/aplay; do
    killall --quiet --wait --signal KILL $PROCESS
done
rm -rf /tmp/jack*

Hi,


This thread became a really good lowlatency tutorial, great! :) I'm not sure 
what this IO_support thing is, but I guess it's in Jan's guide.

There's just one other thing I thought I'd add that I didn't see mentioned 
anywhere.
By default a linux system is running cron daemons that schedule the execution 
of different "things" at recurring intervals. 
Though I've never heard of anything happening with 20 minute intervals. That 
the spike occured 20 minutes into the the recording also speaks against it. 
It may be a good idea to turn them of though.

Have you made sure you jack tmp directory is mounted from a tmpfs
filesystem? I was getting presistent overruns until Fernando setup Planet
to do it automatically.

Turn it on with hdparm -c 1 /dev/hd<whatever>

It turns on 32bit access for IDE drives, sounds important, it was off
on my system.

Really nice!  I'm an old UNIX guy so I just used the brute force
method.  I did forget to add that I kill syslogd and crond before I run
Ardour.

I sincerely hope though that the day will come when all these temporary 
changes aren't necessary. 
It bugs me that I can't keep _one_ configuration for all computer related 
work.
I want a system where I can start all services/daemons I use and still have 
reliable (preferably good) performance with audio applications.

It's been quite a while since I wandered into Windows-land. Earlier these 
issues where similar there too... is it still so?

What about OS X, my gut feeling is that you don't need to worry as much with 
it, or is it similarily broken?

...Not that I would -ever- consider switching (got a long list of related and 
unrelated reasons for that), but it's good to know if one's wishes will ever 
be granted or if they are just pipe-dreams.

FWIW I dont do any of those things. I even found that MySQL and apache had
been running of my RT audio system for a week or so withouyt problems. I
do generally kill magicdev though.

http://jackeq.sf.net. (only cvs, gtk+-2.0).

For those of you who are interested in DJ/CJ tools, tools for live
performance, and LADSPA plugin guis, you may be interested in a new app 
we are creating based on the code from JAMin. It's called jackEQ. The 
core is a new plugin Steve Harris released recently called DJ EQ which 
is a three band EQ commonly found on dj mixing consoles. It's currently 
only available in the swh-snapshots directory.

jackEQ is in its infancy but we now have 4 stereo (8 mono) i/o channels 
with eq, meters and independant gain control. All channels are routed to 
a master and monitor output or you can take them direct out too.

I would like it to be able to do all these things eventually:

2 x cross faders (all channels and combinations)
unlimited channels.
jack port connection ala freq tweak style
Beat counting support
controlled via keyboard or other dj console.

With the above I can now use my four channel (USB) card as a complete 
djing tool. You could also use a two channel card in a similar (mono) way.

The monitor is assignable to seperate output channels than the master
outs for simple previewing of tracks. All the channels are routed 
through it with a simple button press if needed. The eq's are adjusted 
before the signal arrives at the monitor.

This is how I intend to use it:

mon    ch1 ch2 ch3 ch4 echo
|-------|------------|---|---->internal---->ardour
out1&2        out3&4
              external--------->sound system

------------

I have been wanting this functionality for the past 4 years. Now I can 
start mixing demos/albums from the comfort of home.

Big ups to Steve for providing the bulk of the knowledge base, the JAMin 
crew for making the gui happen and the LADs for keeping it real with da 
open source flavah.

If you don't know this you don't know JACK.

PTLE for me. Thought about an 002 and decided before I jumped I'd give
Linux a try.


Absolutely. I need to go to Guitar Center an buy my latest 6.01 upgrade
if I want to stay on the treadmill.


Yep, this is a problem. My solution was to use a 1394 drive for my audio
drive, both under Pro Tools (Win XP) and Linux. It then doubles as a
simple way to get data between boxes if I don't want to spend time
messign with getting Samba working...



Once again yes...


I'm terrible at kernel configuration, so I hope someone else will help
more with this part.



OK, I certainly get how this has happened, but I eventually tricked my
Dell P3 500 box that runs GigaStudio into playing nice. It was no fun
though. Here's the short version of the story...

1) There are two ways IRQs get assigned, both depending on BIOS:
a) BIOS gives you an option to set an IRQ on a per PCI slot basis
b) BIOS jest sets them.

2) My P3-500 (which sounds like your machine) just assigned specific
IRQs to specific slots. In this case I had to look at what cards were
getting what IRQs and then rearrange cards to get the IRQ.

3) In your case I see the eth0 has IRQ11 which is a good IRQ. I looked
at the IWill page but was unclear if the Ethernet controller is on the
motherboard or a PCI card. If it's a PCI card, then the way I handled my
Dell was to remove EVERY card except the VGA adapter and then put one
card in at a time, see what interrupt BIOS gave it, decide what card I
wanted to have that interrupt, put that card in and move on to the next
card. It meant a number of boot cycles, but now the machine has run for
18 months with a AudioPhile 2496 and an RME HAmmerfall Light and a 1394
adapter and an Ethernet controller and it's worked great.

I think it took most of a day to get that to work, but I've probably had
close to 500 days of trouble free operation since then.


It is, as long as you're comfortable with the process and realize that
all this screwing around can, if you are unlucky, break something
physically. It's not likely to happen, but it is a small risk.

The thing you probably want to understand is that right now every
Ethernet packet that arrives has higher priority than your sound card or
your disk drives. IRQ11 beats IRQ14/15 for the disks or IRQ5 for the
sound card.

So, if your Ethernet adapter is a card, take it and the sound card out,
put the sound card in the Ethernet slot, and then reboot and see what
you get.


Possibly. Not sure. I don't remember building drivers for mine, but
that's another PC than this one.

I see that there have been many other response to this thread, so I'll
have to read what other said.

Cheers,
Mark

Hi,

That person was me. Unfortunately I am going to be away for a week, but 
I'll dig up the sources when I get back. IIRC, I might need to tidy a 
few nasty hacks in order to get it to compile on other peoples machines.

regards, Jordan.

ps feel free to remind me off list in a week or so if you don't hear 
anything.

Stew,
   As others have said, check out PlanetCCRMA. I use it on a couple of =
my machines and it's great for Redhat users. Fernando also tends to be =
pretty responsive to questions asked on that list as it's pretty low =
bandwidth and a very focused group of users.

   That said, I think that there is no 'Redhat sound stuff'. What might =
be running depends on what windows environment you are running. KDE and =
Gnome use different sound servers, I think. fluxbox, which I use for =
audio applications, uses no sound server so Alsa has nothing to conflict =
with.

   If you are using KDE, then there is a system configuration panel in =
the KDE menus, and in that panel there is a sound configuration page. =
-->><<--__-->><<--
that item says, and also tell KDE not to play any sounds. You might also =
want to turn off the automatic polling of your CD drive for audio disks =
as this will sometimes start Arts also.

   As for Gnome, I don't use it so I don't know how to help you there, =
but I'm sure it's probably pretty similar.

   Again, you could try out fluxbox as you will have no conflicts using =
it, but many GUI oriented folks think it's too minimalistic. It all =
comes down to preferences.

   One last option. A app called qjackctl has some commands for stopping =
other sound servers before it starts Jack for Alsa. You might try that =
out, even if you're not going to use Jack.

Cheers,
Mark

Are you running an 001, then?  I bought my Digidesign AudioMedia III card
(2-in, 2-out, analog or digital) just a few months before the 001 was
announced.  Needless to say, it was rather frustrating that there was no
upgrade path.  My studio partner and I were also unfortunate enough to
purchase our MIX plus system just shortly before Pro Tools HD was announced.


We're still at 5.1.3.  We'd have to upgrade all of our plug-ins to MacOS X
versions if we switched to PT6 :(


This sounds like a great solution.  In a pinch, it would also be away of
getting files between here and the studio.  I'll definitely have to look
into that.


?
I'm confused by what you quoted.  XF86Config is my X configuration.  .config
is my kernel configuration.


Thanks, I'll try your technique as soon as I can make the time.


Yup - this irks me to no end, but I wasn't able to fix it in my initial
effort.


This was the first thing I tried.  Same IRQ asignments even after the
change.  I'd look up the BIOS settings so I could better explain the
problem, but my Linux box is building a new kernel right now.


Come to think of it, I'm not sure whether I've even looked for the drive
under Linux since I plugged it in.  It might actually be there.  I suppose
I'd have to build the controller drivers in order to access the drive at any
reasonable speed, however.

Just wanted to post one final update before I go to bed (which I should have
done hours ago.)  I spent quite a while playing with disk buffer settings,
looking through the kernel source, and digging up info online.  Needless to
say, I learned a *lot* along the way.  I made some tweaks, including
changing the values of 4 numeric constants in the kernel source, and
altering the values of /proc/sys/vm/dirty_*

The changes I made *did* seem to improve performance (at least on the
benchmarks), but I was still getting big spikes on the disk write graph,
caused (as Mark pointed out) by the journal being written to a different
part of the disk.  It took me several hours to remember that my disused
Debian partition was formatted as ext2.  Upon remembering this, I ran the
test on this partition, and achieved maximum latencies of 1.5-1.6 ms. for
all 5 tests.  Here are the results of running latencytest-0.42-png on both
filesystems, with and without the disk buffer modifications:

reiserfs, without tweaks:
http://www.comevisit.com/NorthernSunrise/latency/regularreiserfs/3x256.html

reiserfs, with tweaks:
http://www.comevisit.com/NorthernSunrise/latency/tweakedreiserfs/3x256.html

ext2, without tweaks:
http://www.comevisit.com/NorthernSunrise/latency/regularext2/3x256.html

ext2, with tweaks:
http://www.comevisit.com/NorthernSunrise/latency/tweakedext2/3x256.html

The biggest bottleneck is certainly the journal, but the disk buffers appear
to be contributing a little bit as well.  The changes that I made were
fairly extreme, not to mention uneducated.  I suspect that these changes
would also have a strong detrimental effect on overall data throughput,
since I essentially crippled the entire caching system.  I'd be interested
in seeing whether continued experimentation could lead to the same 1.6
millisecond results with milder settings.  Just for the record, the changes
I made were:

- Changed MAX_WRITEBACK_PAGES in mm/page-writeback.c from 1024 to 8
- Changed ratelimit_pages in mm/page-writeback.c from 32 to 2
- Changed MIN_PDFLUSH_THREADS in mm/pdflush.c from 2 to 16
- Changed MAX_PDFLUSH_THREADS in mm/pdflush.c from 8 to 32
- Changed /proc/sys/vm/dirty_background_ratio from 10 to 1
- Changed /proc/sys/vm/dirty_expire_centisecs from 3000 to 1
- Changed /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio from 40 to 1
- Changed /proc/sys/vm/dirty_writeback_centisecs from 500 to 1

The basic idea was to force frequent buffer flushes, make each flush
smaller, and spread the flushes throughout different threads to stagger the
timing.

I'm off to get some sleep now.  Thanks to everyone for the help!

I also have no experience with using Gnome. Artsd conflicts with ALSA like 
nothing else AFAIK.


I would really recommend fluxbox if you've tried it and frozen in fear at the 
apparently blank screen going '"erk, where are all my lovely widgets and 
icons" - and that has sent you screaming for the comfort of Gnome or KDE - 
You don't need 'em, you won't miss 'em. Right-click and it all comes up on 
one menu. It's beautiful and it doesn't get in the way, it's easy to 
customise and does what you need it to do. Since I got used to it, everything 
else seems clunky and over complicated. It's worth geting used to for 
resource intensive stuff like music making even if  you resort back to 
something else for your office & internet work.

God I'm such a chauvinist.

Interesting results. I'm not sure I'm willing to give up my journal
though...

Another variable you might try (if you havent allready) is the disk
elevator - its pretty common on systems with intelligent disks to turn it
way down.

- Steve



-->><<--__-->><<--

 Gnome has its own server. You can turn it off. Same with artsd.
 Gnome2's pretty excellent. {So's KDE... I like mixing and matching.}


 FVWM is very nice... has a small footprint and has a lot more options and features.
 Windowmaker is wonderful for almost anything. Sawfish is nice if you want to script
 stuff. Ice has all sorts of features and one zillion themes {Tho' I'm running it
 with the motif clone.} MWM from http://www.opengroup.org/openmotif/ is about as
 customizable as it gets... running it somehow makes your system feel like it's
 lubricated... :} XFCE http://www.xfce.org/ is really fast, really full featured
 has all the desktop stuff as well as a fast windowmanager {a perfect desktop for
 black/fluxbox {tho' the stuff that goes along with fluxbox is very cool as well 
 http://www.fluxbox.org/ }}, :} I've never liked openlook {too fancy}, apparently
 I need to compile scwm from cvs iin order to run it on rh9 {and I haven't had 
 time to do that.} 

 There are some very minimal window managers available...
 http://freshmeat.net/browse/56/?topic_id=56 some of them are excellent

 {Debian lets you download most of them with dselect.}

I'm not sure about that.  Probably just nobody would see the
announcements, and the people who aren't subscribed to
linux-audio-announce would continue to forget it exists.

The difference in readership is really substantial:

  http://www.linuxdj.com/audio/lad/subscribe.php3

enough that it's pretty much a practical necessity to crosspost
for major releases, even if in principle it may not be a good
idea.  Rather than just stopping, it would be better to find
other ways to encourage people to subscribe to LAA first.

(Hey, everyone -- subscribe to LAA now!)

The other reasonable viewpoint is that you should subscribe to
LAA only if you are _not_ subscribed to LAD or LAU but you still
want to get the announcements.  If that is a common viewpoint,
that would certainly explain the difference in subscriber counts.


Chris




-->><<--__-->><<--

It was discussed at the list creation time.  LAA is for people who
*only* want announcements.  Therefore, announcements should be
cross-posted.  I'm surprised it doesn't say something like that on the
webpage.

Where does it search the plugin? I've compiled both (jackeq and
swh-snapshot) without problems, but when I try to start jackeq it
returns with: 
Cannot find plugin 'dj_eq_1901.so'
Required plugin 'dj_eq_1901.so' missing.
But the plugin exists in the ladspa plugin dir (on SuSE 8.2
/usr/lib/ladspa) and works perfectly when I run it from sweep, for
example...
Any hints?

I'm happy to be back after about 2 years away from Linux.  The audio/music world seems to be taking off and thats great.  I'd like some general comments on what would be peoples favorite reactor type synth in Linux as of now.  I'm primarily interested in realtime, multi timbral midi controlled synths.  How about sequencers?  Thanks for any advice,

Indeed!


I simply love csound. It's flexible, powerful, stable and well
documented. I know that some (most?) people find the fact that it's text
based a minus, but I don't agree. After working with pd intensely for a
couple of weeks I realized that I work much faster in csound.

I'm running csound under debian/unstable on kernel 2.6.0-test5 with a
csound buffersize of 128 on a PIV 2400 laptop, using Evolution USB
keyboards as controllers. I have more polyphony in real time than I can
use with two hands for "normal" (subtractive, fm, sample playback,
soundfont playback, additive) patches. This is even with a few global FX
units (chorus, delay and rotary speaker) running all the time.

The only not-so-nice thing about csound is that I didn't manage (or try
that hard, actually) to make it run alongside other sound-producing
applications, including jack, pd or fluidsynth.  Could be a problem if
you want to use LADSPA plugins or do hd-recording...


I didn't work much with sequencers under linux, but FWIW I've settled on
Muse. Needless to say it's quite simple to route midi events from Muse
to csound.

abSynth

Spiral-Synth-Modular (ssm)

sequencers - Rosegarden or Muse I suppose...

Hi Atte,
I've used Csound alot in the past too.  Mostly command line from Common Music which I like alot.  I'm trying to go more real-time though now.  I just decided I would try and get into PD!  

How is your orchestra set-up.  Do you have 1 synth per instrument per channel?  I always had a hard time in Csound as I wanted to have 1 synth per 16 channels and have them all have their own set of presets.  PD supports multiple midi ports so I thought that would probably work, though learning another language will be tough as I know Csound well.  I also want the graphic routines, and as you know Csound dosen't have the Opengl stuff in Linux, (yet).  I also don't understand the status of Csound right now.  Is anyone actually working on coding Csound5?  I'm on the lists but can't tell.
Thanks,
Ken

I believe that "jacklaunch csound ..." will work as if you install
libjackasyn, but I've not tried it.

Personally I prefer sfront to csound, it has a more human friendly syntax=
,
and has fledling native jack support.

n

Rosegarden is also good. And hydrogen is good if you just want drums.

Csound can do realtime stuff also.


csound supports that also.  

This is how you bind different instruments to midi channels:
; massign    ichnl, insnum
massign 1, 1
massign 2, 2	 ;bind instr 2 to midi channel 2
massign 3, 2

openGL support I don't know about that but you can use fltk controlers or tk
sliders.  A good environment maybe cecilia using fltk controlers and or tk sliders. The fltk controlers can be data entry fields sliders, nobs, or whatever. 

On the other hand pd can use csound as an extension.  Can you do non
realtime stuff in pd.  I was wondering if you can render stuff as a wav
or aiff in non realtime.  The reason I ask is if you have extremly
complex tasks that your computer can't do in realtime you have that
rendered instead.  Then if you can composite openGL and the audio
together into a format similar to divx or something that would be really
cool.  

Right now I am using gimp,povray, or blender to do animation like stuff
and csounds for audio.  I then composit them in Cinelerra.

Tim/ Mark,

Thanks for your comments, I must admit I am struggling a bit. My aim is =
to build a dual-purpose machine, none of which require a fancy gui. I'm =
building an app server for work related stuff (DB, WebServer etc.) and =
when it's doing those jobs I wont need any of the music/ sound related =
stuff. And a MAME station, fully kitted out in a dedicated cabinet. So I =
need alsa for xmame, I don't need it for any music related stuff as I do =
that on an XP setup I've got on a better PC.

So if anyones got any pointers to getting the simplest setup up and =
running I really would appreciate it. Bandwith isn't an issue, so if =
there's a distribution that comes with alsa and config as part of the =
setup.............. maybe?

Sounds like me two months ago. Maybe you make it (I didn't) :-)


One long (1600+ lines) .csd file with
* one "patch/synth" per instr which gives one one patch per program
change
* a few global (always on) fx instruments
* a special "output instrument" that does a little eq + compression
* patching/routing with global variables.

Each USB keyboard sends on a seperate midi channel, but they all access
the same pool of patches. Since the Evolution will let you assign a
program change to each of the 0-9 buttons (and remember them after
poweroff) I always use the same Evolution for the same thing (one for
pads for instance) and program each button to point to different
instr's.


You could run multiple instances of csound, which might (or might
not...) give relatively poorer performance. But I don't understand why
this configuration is paramount to you..??!?


Be prepared that pd doesn't handle polyphonic patches gracefully IMHO.


Might be, never messed with that...


AFAIK the guys are working like mad, cleaning up code (and API's?) and
preparing for csound5. I even thing it's for download somewhere, maybee
sourceforge somewhere. You might also be pleased to hear that csound
recently turned GPL. There are still a few contributed opcodes that
haven't been GPL'ed (scanned opcodes for instance) but that's probl.
gonna happen soon from what I hear.

	Ardour is the correct answer.  I was using SLAB prior to Ardour (it's
pretty nice but not on the same level).  When I first started with
Ardour I was using an es1371.  Check out
http://myweb.cableone.net/eviltwin69/ALSA_JACK_ARDOUR.html to get an
idea of what's involved (I haven't updated since the tarballs came out
so it's a bit easier now).  Also, "Planet CCRMA at home" has a ton of
stuff and is the easy way to get started on Red Hat

Stew,

You might want to have a look at Debian/unstable. Debian has the
reputation of being not that easy to install (I had no problems, though;
And these guys are developing a new installer, I think), but once
it's up and running it is really easy to keep up to date. Furthermore,
Debian comes with a _really_ huge amount of packages, containing all the
audio apps you need (I think).

Hallo,



Can Csound do runtime changes to its patches now? I think one of the
major differences between Pd/(j)Max and 'compiled' languages like
Csound or sfront is the ability to directly edit a patch while it is
running. It's a bit like: Csound is great if you know what you're
doing in advance, while with Pd you can experiment and immediatly hear
or see what you're developing while you're doing so.

Of course it is dangerous to just let Pd patches stay that: an
interactive work-in-progess mess. But in general I've found that in Pd
I would build things - with the same "opcodes" or building blocks as
in Csound -, I would have never thought of while still using Csound.

I *think* (never used it yet) that Supercollider is somehow in between
in that it has a dynamic, interactive language interpreter a bit like
the one in Python.

Supercollider seems to be the coolest anyway. I want Debian packages
of it ;)

I was working with ardour and it looked really good. But then I kept 
running into problems with Jack also. So I went back to using ecasound. 
It's a command line multitrack recorder, but does a lot more, (like fx, 
file conversions, ladspa plugins...). I plan on getting Jack running 
some day. But for now, I can do everything I need with ecasound. It's 
very stable and powerful. And there's a very good Front End called 
"tkeca". But I would wait for the next version of tkeca because the 
developer said that He will be working on fixing some bugs and/or adding 
certain features. But the last version of tkeca was promising. But if 
you don't mind a command line multitracker go with ecasound. I recomend 
using the "-c" option. It puts it in "interactive mode" so that You can 
do "t" to start, "fw xx" to fast forward xx seconds, "setpos xx" to seek 
to xx seconds into the recording (just to name a few).

By the way, if you use Midnight Commander (file utility program), 
ecasound becomes much easier to work with because you can create a bash 
script with all of the ecasound settings in it and press enter to run 
it. then You can press F4 on the file and make changes with the Midnight 
Commander's internal editor and and then simply press enter on the 
script file to run it again. You can use Midinight Commander's ablity to 
reconize a file type and configure it to use ecasound to play a wav, mp3 
or whatever file format you're using, so You can quickly view a single 
track if nesesary. ecasound also has a few of it's own file formats that 
you can use along with Midnight Commander also for "quick viewing" or 
testing of things. I found this set up to be a quick way to make 
changes, view things quickly and record quickly and efficiently.

type "mc" into the bash shell to see if you have Midinight Commander 
installed.

I'm guessing this is the same bug as in JAMin, if LADSPA_PATH isnt set it

I use Debian/stable plus the packages available via DeMuDi/agnula. I also 
found Debian ok to install, although you do have to know your hardware better 
as it doesn't auto-detect much. You can install the bulk of it plus low-lat 
kernel using tasksel during the second part of the installation process. Last 
I looked it wasn't actually labelled as such, but the option is there. I had 
to do a little 'figuration on my system to get the music apps to work, but 
mine's an old box cobbled together out of bits. It is so easy to keep it up

Dear all,

as announced earlier on this list, the 2nd LAD conference will take place
April 29th - May 2nd 2004 at ZKM (Zentrum fuer Kunst und Medientechnologie,
Center for Art and Media) Karlsruhe, Germany.

http://www.linuxdj.com/audio/lad/eventszkm2003.php3
lists presentation material and reports of the 1st conference.

See http://www.linuxdj.com/audio/lad/eventszkm2004.php3
for more information on the 2nd conference.

Many participants of the 1st conference have already confirmed their
participation for the 2nd one. Frank and I would now like to collect
abstracts for planned talks so that we can set up a preliminary program.
We would like to have this available as soon as possible so that we can
advertise the event in computer music journals (such as german Keyboards ;-)
and linux journals (Dave, Daniel, are you listening ?).

If you plan to give a talk on Linux audio development or do a presentation
of music you have done with Linux software, please send an abstract to
both me and Frank Neumann (Frank.Neumann_AT_st_DOT_com). Please estimate
the time you need for your talk so that we can set up a preliminary
schedule.

We have now three different locations for presentations: The lecture hall
we used for the 1st conference, some seminar rooms and the Kubus, which is
considerable larger than the lecture hall and has a built-in studio.

The seminar rooms can be used for LAD internal presentations and discussion.
The Kubus is ideal for presentations of high public interest, especially
practical demonstrations of audio software. The lecture hall will be used
for technical talks on software development. In short terms: Kubus is LAU,
Lecture hall is LAD.

More rooms imply the option of scheduling parallel sessions. We can only
decide on this after we know roughly how many presentations are to be
expected. This is another reason why early registration is helpful.

Given the excellent conditions at ZKM and the many improvements of Linux
audio software, the second conference promises to be even more successful
than its predecessor.

 {From the homepage, it's in the works though.}... and to tell
 you the truth... I'm not quite sure if Brahms does or not.



-->><<--__-->><<--

Besides, I'm not sure whether either of them is being actively worked on 
any more.  The last minor release of Anthem (0.0.17?) was over a year 
ago according to its SourceForge page, and the last Brahms snapshot was 
an informal one from last October.

I don't want to suggest that either project is actually dead, because 
the Rosegarden project used to look dead for several years and it's 
very active now... well, okay, maybe it was sort of dead at the time. 
Anyway, I guess at least I'd like to know if anyone else here has any 
more information about what's happening with either of them.

Well of course you have to make a change to your text file, save it and
rerun csound on it. Maybe the emacs mode and friends make things more
interactive, but the old way works great for me. But I must admit that
this is probl. only because I use realtime input from keyboards with
assignable potmeters 90% of the time. If we're talking pure csound
driven by an .sco file I'm working much too slow. In fact I never
completed one single project in pure csound.


Maybe one ought to check it out. Just for the fun of it...

Hello -

I was wondering if someone could help me along with getting VST's running
under Linux.

I have installed the version of WINE from the vstserver download area.  I
have also built vstserver and can in fact run it.  Finally, I have built
ladspavst.

This is where I am stuck.  The ladspavst README didn't have any info to help
figure out how to run it.

Building ladspavst made vst.so.  What now?

What I would like to try is getting VST's running with Ardour.  Is this
possible?

Also, do any VSTi's work with vstserver?

Thanks for any and all info...

Hi
Thanks for getting my son hooked on audacity, but now I am getting more 
questions. I have audacity-1.2 now and I like the feature (esp looping). I 
can import a MIDI file but then cannot play it. I do not see any setting 
for MIDI out on the preferences. I get a device not found error when I 
play a midi track. Am I missing anything.

Thanks





-->><<--__-->><<--

I hope I am not spreading the wrong info but I know Cinelerra was
orriginally a multitrack recorder. It seems rather intuitive at
recording many tracks at once.  The thing I think that is not intuitive
about is overdubbing or recording a track 3 while listening to tracks 1
and 2 that gave been previously recorded. If it is possible it totally
went over my head. I tried unclicking the record on tracks one and two
while leaving record on then I figured I could either hit r to open up
the record window.  That did not play the tracks one and two while I was
trying to record.  I also tried it in the main window by adding an extra
track and then I did not have a clue on how to record from that.  I
believe you could actually record with bcast2000 from the main window.

I have alot of mixed feelings about Cinelerra It has a beautiful gui
that for the most part has gotten alot more intuitive since bcast2000.
It kind of bothers me that it is so difficult to compile and that for
the most part it is only for x86. The reason for this is because it has
hand made assemly code in it. I heard some people tried to port it
to it to the ppc but it was not incredibly stable. I like many of the
features. Don't get me wrong it has some incredible features.  I just
wish that I think there is only one guy working on it and he does not
accept patches from developers and there is no cvs.  

Jeremiah





-->><<--__-->><<--

My guess would be that you need to put vst.so in whatever 
directory Ladspa plugins go (under Mandrake 9.1, it's 
/usr/lib/ladspa) and then run your ladspa client app and see if 
it's one of the available plugins.

Maybe you'd need to ldconfig after putting that file there, I 
dunno.  Haven't had any VST's to play with myself.

i'm having the same problem unfortunately.

the only instructions i see are to
1-set VST_PATH environment variable to point to where your plugins are
  eg: /usr/share/vst
2-launch vstserver from its directory
  eg: cd /usr/lib/vst/; vstserver;

i have vstserver running but it just waits:
"VSTSERVER/main: Vstserver 0.2.6 started. Waiting for requests."

the vstserver 'exampleclient' works for me, but jack-rack, pd, and 
ardour dont. 

does anyone have it working? it would be nice to know what was
supposed to happen, and which clients are known to work.


i'm using thacs rpms:
libladspavst-0.1.2-5mdk
k_vst~-0.2.6-2mdk
vstserver-0.2.6-2mdk
libvst-devel-0.2.6-1mdk
libvst-0.2.6-1mdk

Did you use a slur or a tie?  If you used a slur, then you should
indeed get four notes.  You probably wanted to tie the notes using
the tie function on the Transforms menu (which we'll probably move
to the Group menu soon, where it'll be a bit more obvious) or the
tie button on the Group toolbar.

(The two are displayed differently on screen.  Slurs are shown as
rounded curves; ties are flat with curved ends.)

     |\      
 ----|-|----O----------------|-----------------O-------|      
     | /   |             |   |       |        |        |         
 --- |/----|-------------|---|-------|--------|--------|      
    /|     |             |   |       |        |        |         
 - /-|- ---|-------------|---|-------|--------|--------|      
  | /| \   |             |   |       |        |        |         
 --\ | /---|-------------|---|-------|--------|--------|      
    -|-                 O    |      O                  |         
 ----|- -----------------\---|-----/-------------------|      
  * -                     \-------/                       


If I import into Rosegarden the score editor says

     |\
 ----|-|----O---------------|-----------------O-------|
     | /   |                |                |        |
 --- |/----|----------------|----------------|--------|
    /|     |                |                |        |
 - /-|- ---|----------------|----------------|--------|
  | /| \   |                |                |        |
 --\ | /---|----------------|----------------|--------|
    -|-                 O   |                         |
 ----|- --------------------|-------------------------|
  * -                   

I assume this is a bug.(?)

 like you would in anything else... line them up, put fades and effects on them,
 toss other stuff into the mix.
 
 Why is this difficult? Are you looking for something like fruity loops that
 makes it easy to assemble the loops themselves? What sort of functionality
 are you wanting?







-->><<--__-->><<--

No, it's just that as Rosegarden is also a MIDI sequencer, it
prefers by default not to split and tie notes unless you ask it to
(as it would disturb the underlying performance representation).

But you can tell it to do what you want when importing MIDI.  Go to
the configuration dialog's Notation page, and then on the Quantize
pane (which controls the way MIDI is quantized for notation on
import) tick the "Tie notes at barlines etc" option.  You may want
to tick "Split-and-tie overlapping chords" as well.

Now if _those_ options don't work, well _that_'s a bug...

 There's a forum on sourceforge for it... That would probably be the best
 place to get help with it. I've not tried recording with it.. most
 everything I do {animation, sound/noisescapey stuff, weird loopy musical
 things} is generated/synthesized on the computer.


 There's a copy in the audio turnkey package. At least there used to be.
 I'm sure you can get it elsewhere as well. Mandrake, maybe?


 I know that you can get the code, betas, backups, etc...

 It is difficult to compile. You can get it from planet ccrma though.

Check the Ardour archives. We had this discussion back around last January.
Actually, someone did a patch for Ardour that painted loops much like Acid
does. You placed the loop where you wanted it to start and then did a drag
to the right. If you went farther than the length of the loop then Ardour
put in a second copy of the loop, just like Acid.

Ardour was actually sort of nicer than Acid in that you could put multiple
loops on the same track. Acid doesn't allow that.

I think that none of this eventually made it into CVS, but I could be wrong.
maybe the functionality is there somewhere. (I don't use Ardour.)

Thanks SO MUCH!

I was able to get an instance of the CamelPhat Free VST loaded this morning
in Ardour.  All I had to do is put the vst.so file in /usr/lib/ladspa.

I'll do more testing with different VST's later.

Is anyone keeping a list of VST's that work with vstserver?  Is that

Still not quite what I meant.  Maybe there's a different term than 
"loop".    

How do you audition a guitar solo, for instance?  You'd want to listen 
to it a few times without having to press stop/rewind/play every time?

Cheers,

-->><<--__-->><<--

I can load sample files into Ardour (but can't line them up without 
pixel-precision accuracy with the mouse ...) apply fx etc but I'd like 
to select a section of a track and listen to it over and over (applying 
fx, listen for mistakes etc) - Ardour does not have this facilty.  I'd 
like : select a section, play, tweeek just that section without having 
to press play over and over again.

All windows audio apps have this facillty :)

How do people here edit your tracks - do you place the start point 
somewhere, press play, listen, press stop, put the start point back, 
press play, listen ... seems odd to me.  Even my old Yamaha QY-10 had a 
loop facility, and my cassette tape portastudio had one!

Cheers,

Andy

Ah, the beauty of the English language, 'eh? 'Loops' (a noun) vs. 'looping'.
(a verb) ;-) Now I understand your request. Since I am not an Ardour user I
cannot say anything about the actual method used to do this in it's GUI. I
seem to remember a symbol for this in it's transport, but I don't know....

As you explore this, don't forget 'loop recording', where I play and record
new audio for the same guitar segment over and over again until I get the
copy I want to keep.

sorry for the confusion.

As far as I know, the paint feature is still in there.  I don't know if it still works though.  There are a lot of features, and we might not know if something is broken until someone tries it out.

Currently, this *can* be done in ardour, but the steps needed
are less than intuitive.

1. make a range selection
2. right-click to popup menu, choose "Select->New Location from selection"
   (note, *not*  Selection->LoopSelection !!)
3. open the Locations window from the Windows menu
4. check the Loop column for the location you just made
5. Select the loop button (icon) in the transport bar
6. Position the playhead somewhere in or before the loop area
   and press play.

When you change the checked loop location you may have to reselect
the loop transport button (bug). Also, when you delete a location
(by shift-right-clicking on the marker bar), it won't delete it
from the location window (bug).
 
I will do my best to make this a much more streamlined process
in future versions of ardour.

 Load it in rezound and play it over and over tweaking and fiddling to
 your hearts content... until you think you have it right. Then export
 it. You could actually export it to the length of your song and edit
 from there.


 That's nice.


 You could set your program to loop.




-->><<--__-->><<--


Copy this into a file named foo.pd:

#N canvas 588 282 450 300 10;
#X msg 56 45 opengui;
#X msg 147 46 closegui;
#X obj 147 120 k_vst~ NorthPole;
#X obj 211 78 adc~;
#X obj 215 160 dac~;
#X connect 0 0 2 0;
#X connect 1 0 2 0;
#X connect 2 1 4 0;
#X connect 2 2 4 1;
#X connect 3 0 2 1;
#X connect 3 1 2 2;

Replace "NorthPole" with the name of whatever plugin you want to try,
leaving off the extension. Then start the vstserver
('~/vstserver-0.2.7/vstserver') in its own window. In another xterm open
Pd. I start it like this:

  pd -lib /home/dlphilp/k_vst~/k_vst~ -open
/home/dlphilp/my_pd_files/foo.pd

I've placed an image of the outcome on-line here:

  http://linux-sound.org/pd-vst-pic.html

Note that I'm using the latest versions of WINE, vstserver, and k_vst~.
I hope that all helps a bit.

Hi
Is there a way to convert one channel from a midi file to wav and then 
import it to audacity. I know I can use timidity to convert midi to wav, 
what would be the best way to just export one channel to wav.

Just having a loop region or selection menu item would go a long way.

according to the pd k_vst~ readme, pd supports

Greetings:

  In the process of providing Tim with an example I found that some
severe instability sporadically occurs with the following setup:

	Pd 0.37 (final)
	vstserver 0.2.7
	k_vst~ (latest)
	WINE 20030911 from WineHQ (i.e., not Kjetil's)

  Sometimes the server will go into an endless loop of "wine client
error" messages. No problem, I can kill the process with no difficulty,
but it would be nicer if it didn't happen. ;)  The spin usually takes
place when I'm setting up the Pd patch for more than one plugin, but
unfortunately it doesn't happen all the time. I'll try Kjetil's version
of WINE later today.

  Btw, I agree that it would be good to have a list of VST plugins known
to work in the environment. Alas, I have no time to put into such a
thing, but I will gladly donate my own list and comments.

Are you sure you could do it with other versions of Jack?

I don't know how Snd works, but it seems probable that it opens the 
sound-device on startup. And if it is occupied by a sound-server, any 
sound-server, the app may not start.

Now that I think about it, no, I'm not sure about that. I've usually
reserved JACK use for Ardour, so I might not have ever tried running a

I'm pretty sure Snd operates in just that manner, and I understand what

What's your soundcard?  I think being able to open a sound device multiple times is dependent on if the hardware supports that.  I can run jack and xmms (without the jack plugin) concurrently on my sb512.

Dunno how it works with my envy24 card, as I generally only run one app at the

My work computer which has really lousy ac97 drivers definately locks things

IIRC it's possible to open devices in non blocking mode, for which this

Neither of my RME cards (Hammerfall Light or HDSP 9652) have ever allowed me
to do this. To my mind this is why I have always asked new app developers
that don't have a Jack interface to add Jack support, so that I can use
multiple apps at the same time.

As someone else pointed out, doesn't using multiple apps place some
interesting requirements on the hardware? What does the hardware do if the
apps are running at different frequencies?

Anyway, for me the problem you site has always been there, and is the best
reason for all Linux sound apps to support Jack.

Jesse,
   That's come along quite a bit.

   I'm not sure from your description above whether Ardour does this, but
there is one thing you might want to look at for loop recording more human
friendly. It's really nice if the loop selection and the recording selection
can be made to be different lengths. The issue is that the musician needs to
hear a lead in to the point where they start to do their work, and to make
it human friendly the whole process needs to stay in the groove or it's hard
to be musical.

   Consider this situation:

1) I'm doing a song with a guitar part that I'm going to record in two
pieces. The first piece goes up to the end of measure 50, and the second
starts at measure 51 and goes to the end of measure 59.

2) I've recorded something good for the first part and now I want to loop
record the second part.

3) To get the groove right, I need the loop point to jump back to the
beginning of measure 49 so I hear 49 and 50, and then as the play head
crosses into 51 the recording starts and I record the second parts.

4) Fairly important is that I need to hear the first guitar part AND my live
guitar through 49 & 50, but nothing I play in 49 & 50 is recorded.

5) Mucho important - Nothing about recording the second guitar part should
be in any way destructive to the first guitar part that is already recorded.

   After all this gets done, then you end up doing fades between the audio
segments, etc., to put it all together.

   Don't know how much of that you've already got. Quite a bit I expect.

Cheers,
Mark





-->><<--__-->><<--


Thanks, Kjetil. I got the mda_JX10 synth and tested the patch, it worked
fine (but no GUI, alas). I also tried the compakt and Barking Wombat
synths again with that example, both worked fine and both showed their
GUIs (after I added the opengui/closegui messages to the patch).
However, I still haven't figured out how to sound the patch via my MIDI
keyboard.

The vstserver is still very shaky. It often crashes after changing the
DLL name in the k_vst~ object. I can start the whole thing again with
the revised patch and it will work fine (until I try changing the DLL
again). Btw, I built and installed your version of WINE (from the NoTAM
site) and rebuilt the vstserver.

I tried utilizing the MIDI input components from the audio/MIDI test
patch but even though it shows MIDI data coming from my keyboard I'm
still not sounding the VSTi plugin. Suggestions ?

Best regards,

Mark,

Ardour has a configurable pre-roll that I imagine does
 what you describe but haven't used it.

-->><<--__-->><<--

resample.

this is reputedly why the creative cards sound so poor. Even if
your stream is at the cards nominal rate of 48k, it still gets
resampled.

its quite an insidious degredation though. If you listen to the spdif
output of the sblive it seems to sound ok, but if you compare it to the output of
a 'proper' card then the difference is imediately apparent (if you
are sensitive to these things). A lot of detail and beauty is lost.

You could check jacklaunch (jackasyn).
I think it's only for oss apps but it allows to run inside the jack server.  I

other apps (including games and all).

Tim,
   I agree. There are always artifacts from resampling. I didn't know those
cards did that all the time. Yuck.

   In my work I never resample anything, or at least not until the final
master for the physical media is created. I always work at 44.1K, make sure
any samples and tracks others give me are at 44.1K, and make my personal
masters at 44.1KHz for auditioning where ever I need to. Only if I need a
48K for some reason do I do it then.

Being on stage with the band in front of crowds shouting, "Get off! No!
We want normal music!", I think that was more like acting than anything
I've ever done.

 I use 24/96 for audio editing... lets me crank volumes, settings, etc
 without major feedback, clipping and so on... not to mention that the
 sound's a hell of a lot richer.

 If something works out well I'll save it in several different bit depths
 24/96 for a reference file and 16/48 and 24/48 for sequencing. DVDs are
 48. {Stock} I'd like to sequence at higher bitrates but I tend to wonder
 how many folks home stereo can do anything worthwhile with 24/96.

 ...Surround, on the other hand bears exploration. Everyone's got it...
 not a lot of folk author for it. {as far as bands go anyway... spacialization,
 putting the rumble on both sides of the listener, having that floaty/sparkly
 noise swim in front of their face and throwing spears of reverberating high
 frequency stuff at them from the center channel, etc...}

From: Dave Phillips <dlphilp-VeYSLkBxgRSsTnJN9+BGXg@public.gmane.org>
It seems like the newer wine-versions doesnt work quite as well with
the vstserver as the nov-dec2002 versions. I have experienced more
strange behaviour after upgrading too. But it might be coincidental.


Hmm, no. I'm unfortunately not sitting at a linux machine right now.
Cant think of anything. Ask the pd-list perhaps? There seems to
be quite many that use the k_vst~ external on that list.

all very useful information!
but it seems i perhaps have something fundamentally wrong with
my installation...

  #ll /usr/bin/k_vst~.pd_linux;

  tried /usr/bin/k_vst~.pd_linux.pd_linux and failed
  /usr/bin/k_vst~.pd_linux: can't load library

anyone else using thacs rpms?


many thanks

Well, at this point I should run down the process as I've outlined it in
the soon-to-arrive tutorial :

  1. Build & install the vstserver, the ladspa vst host plugin, and the
k_vst~ object.
  2. Start the server.
  3. Use the client(s).

It's possible that the pre-built binary is lacking a dependency. I
advise building all of this stuff from source anyway, and if you have a
working Wine installation (including the devel package!) you shouldn't
have too much trouble. So :

  1. Do you have Wine installed ?
  2. Do you have the Wine devel package installed ?
  3. Did you start the vstserver before running the client ?

I apologize if I'm telling you things you already know, I just want to
be thoroughly clear.

Best regards,

== dp

Sag mal Du hast doch auch PD am Start, oder ???

Jetzt hab ich endlich jmax am laufen und merke dass es
dass was ich suche gar nicht fuer Jmax gibt. Ich suche
sowas wie den Spat.

Subject: LilyPond 2.0 prerelease available
X-Mailer: VM 7.14 under Emacs 21.2.1
Reply-To: hanwen-CnXeQJCHohM@public.gmane.org
FCC: ~/persoonlijk/Mail/sent




I have just released Lilypond 1.9.8. Relative to 1.9.7, it has a
number of small bugfixes and sports dotted hairpin crescendos.
However, this release also marks the end of my 2.0 release TODO
list. In other words, 1.9.8 is the first (and hopefully only) LilyPond
2.0 release candidate.

Please download and test it as widely as possible, before it is
released some time next week.

Enjoy!

Han-Wen



New features in 2.0 since 1.8
*****************************

   * Crescendos can now be drawn dotted or stippled.

   * Quarter tones are now supported. They are entered by suffixing
     `ih' for a half-sharp and `eh' for a half-flat. Hence, the
     following is an ascending list of pitches:

            ceses ceseh ces ceh c cih cis cisih cisis

   * The following constructs have been removed from the syntax:

            \duration #SCHEME-DURATION
            \pitch #SCHEME-PITCH
            \outputproperty FUNC SYMBOL = VALUE

     For `\outputproperty', the following may be substituted:

             \applyoutput #(outputproperty-compatibility FUNC
                            SYMBOL VALUE)

   * Clefs may now be transposed arbitrarily, for example

            \clef "G_8"
            \clef "G_15"
            \clef "G_9"

   * The syntax for chords and simultaneous music have changed.  Chords
     are entered as

             <PITCHES>

     while simultaneous music is entered as

             <<..MUSIC LIST..>>

     In effect, the meanings of both have been swapped relative to
     their 1.8 definition.  The syntax for lists in `\markup' has
     changed alongside, but figured bass mode was not  changed, i.e.:

            \markup { \center <..LIST OF MARKUPS..> }
            \figure { <figures> }

     As chords the more often used than simultaneous music, this change
     will save keystrokes.

   * Each music expression can now be tagged, to make different printed
     versions from the same music expression.  In the following example,
     we see two versions of a piece of music, one for the full score,
     and one with cue notes for the instrumental part:

          < \tag #'part <
            { c4 f2 g }      % in the part, we have cue-notes
            \\ R1 >
            \tag #'score R1  % in the score: only a rest
          >

     The same can be applied to articulations, texts, etc.: they are
     made by prepending

                  -\tag #YOUR-TAGS

     to an articulation, for example,

                  c4-\tag #'with-fingerings -4 -\tag #'with-strings \6

     This defines a note, which has a conditional fingering and a
     string-number indication.

   * The settings for chord-fingering are more flexible. You can
     specify a list where fingerings may be placed, eg.

          	\property Voice.fingeringOrientations = #'(left down)

     This will put the fingering for the lowest note below the chord,
     and the rest to the left.

   * The script previously known as `ly2dvi' has been renamed to
     `lilypond'. The binary itself is now installed as `lilypond-bin'.

   * Markup text (ie. general text formatting) may now be used for
     lyrics too.

   * Two new commands for grace notes have been added, `\acciaccatura'
     and `\appoggiatura',

            \appoggiatura f8 e4
            \acciaccatura g8 f4

     Both reflect the traditional meanings of acciaccatura and
     appogiatura, and both insert insert a slur from the first grace
     note to the main note.

   * Layout options for grace notes are now stored in a context
     property, and may now be set separately from musical content.

   * The `\new' command will create a context with a unique name
     automatically. Hence, for multi-staff scores, it is no longer
     necessary to invent arbitrary context names. For example, a
     two-staff score may be created by

            \simultaneous {
              \new Staff { NOTES FOR 1ST STAFF }
              \new Staff { NOTES FOR 2ND STAFF }
            }

   * Octave checks make octave errors easier to correct.  The syntax is

            \octave PITCH

     This checks that PITCH (without octave) yields PITCH (with octave)
     in \relative mode. If not, a warning is printed, and the octave is
     corrected.

   * All articulations must now be entered postfix. For example,

          	c8[( d8])

     is a pair of beamed slurred eighth notes.

   * The definition of `\relative' has been simplified.  Octaves are
     now always propagated in the order that music is entered. In the
     following example,

            PRE
            \repeat "unfold" 3  BODY \alternative { ALT1 ALT2 }
            POST

     the octave of BODY is based on PRE, the starting octave of ALT1 on
     BODY, the starting octave of ALT2 on ALT1, and the starting octave
     of POST on ALT2.

     The same mechanism is used for all other music expressions, except
     the chord. Backwards compatibility is retained through a special
     program option, which is set through

            #(ly:set-option 'old-relative)

Hey Clemens,

I just tried out the madfu loader with my Sonica and ran into a problem.

usbfs is mounted on /proc/bus/usb

lsusb shows:
Bus 002 Device 003: ID 0763:2805 Midiman

I tried running:
./madfuload -f ma005101.bin -n -D /proc/bus/usb/002/003
and I get:
downloading block 1 failed - No such file or directory

It's definitely finding /proc/bus/usb/002/003, and if I point to a non-existant file I get:
cannot open /foo - No such file or directory

I get the same error if I point it at a non-existant firmware.

I'm running everything as root, running a 2.6.0-test5 kernel.

Anything else I should try?

Thanks,
Stephen Hassard

Hi,

Nice job on the VST page. 

However, I propose that the statement "...we need a
supply of fx and synths to make the platform usable
for some serious work..." is objectionable. Unless
you're suggesting we remove our ladspa based work from
the market or flag the material as not being serious
music. :) 

Obviously I'm being very sarcastic but I stand by my
intended point. 

Perhaps "...we welcome an additional supply of fx and
synths to make the platform even more robust..." is
more accurate.

Reguardless, I think the VST developments and the page
are excellent. Thank you!

ron

-->><<--__-->><<--

yes i agree that it is objectionable and i will change it.

the point i was trying to make is that ladspa only
covers a subset of the needed functionality despite
its obvious merits.

also i meant to differentiate between 'audio' and 'music'.

but i will change it right away.....

Hi,

I just put together a linux box and I'm going to be using the RME Hammerfall DSP w/ the Multiface.  When I do lspci I get:

01:09.0 Multimedia audio controller: Xilinx Corporation RME Hammerfall DSP (rev 32)

I'm kinda confused because I thought the rev should have been either 0a or 0b (or maybe 10 or 11).  On my windows side I ran the firmware updater from the RME website, and I get "hardware revision 50" with a tag that says I don't need to update.  Is this normal?  I don't know if this makes a difference, but I'm currently running RedHat 9 with the kernel from Planet CCRMA (the .caps one rather than the .acpi, which won't work on my hardware for whatever reason).
Slowly but surely I'm gonna get this thing running on Linux.  Any other hints anybody's dying to share?  I'm sure I've missed a ton of conversation about the HDSP in the past... I'll be going through those later.  =o)

Thanks,

Matt Barber

If you are getting revision 32, I think it should be in hex.
Becase 32 in hex is 50 in dec.
(3 x 16) + 2 = 50

Sure, but *is* there a revision with such a high number?

For the Hammerfall DSP system I can only find version 11 (hex 0b) on
RME's web site.  0b is also the version I use and which seems to work
for me.  I did have problems with 0a, but other people run 0a without
any problems.  Maybe my system is just misconfigured, I don't know.

Pro Tools

(sorry it was a non-Linux answer!) 




-->><<--__-->><<--


 It surprises me that they've not ported to linux yet.

 You can't really run their software without their hardware,
 they have something of a UNIX heritage, if they were to open
 source the software it would do them wonders as pr/advertisement,
 it would give them the benefits of linux developers and get them
 as firmly entrenched in the linux world as they are everywhere else.

 {Same for Creamware.}

 {{Linux strikes me as being vastly more suited to industrial scale
 applications than anything else. Lower latency, more stability, it's
 open source and it's free.}}

 Seeing as movie folk and major 3d apps are already running on linux
 it really seems that there's a need there. 

 {Not to dis linux developers but you do need compatibility, standards
 and apps that folk know how to work.}



 

 



-->><<--__-->><<--

To a small extent, me too. They have an OS X version. They could release
a straight Linux version if they wanted to, I'm sure. 


Linux, as a business architecture, is so totally screwed up that I don't
understand how it's supposed to work anymore. When you make hardware you
have to compile drivers. In the Linux world (today anyway) this means
releasing source. DigiDesign doesn't release source, so there's no real
way to support all the different distributions and hardware
configurations that exist. There's probably also a risk that if they
were able to release only a small part that would be compiled on a
target system that someone would hijack it and figure out how to make
Pro Tools work with other hardware, thus undercutting DigiDesign's real
business model which is selling hardware with software to support it.

I think the Linux architecture (or what little of it I understand) makes
this difficult and unlikely to ever happen.

Actually, I think most people look at DigiDesign incorrectly from a
business perspective. They are really a hardware company. They make
their money selling hardware, not software. If they depended on making
money selling software, they'd be no different from Steinberg, etc., so
they relay on their own hardware to differentiate themselves from the
rest of the pack.

Oh, I agree. Pro Tools on Linux would be a great app on a great
platform. DigiDesign would benefit greatly, if they could manage the
security of their source, and if their plug-in manufacturer's would play
ball. Unfortunately, the 001/002/RTAS plugin support has been bad,
except for Waves. The advantage for Pro Tools in Linux would come if
they would embrace LADSPA.

Thanks for your suggestions...
When I run "alsaconf" it finds the HDSP just fine, but when it tries to bring up the volume, I get this message:

I had that problem.  First, no devices were created.  Remember to run 
./snddevices from de alsa-driver??? dierctory.
Second, the driver that comes with Red Hat was installed.  I had to 
remove old modules.
Third: No sound server should be running..

This could be caused by the hdsp driver not recognizing the firmware

Frank,
   It looks interesting on the web page, but it won't run (so far) on my
main Gentoo box. I'm going to try it later today, first under
Redhat/PlanetCCRMA and then Windows if I must.

   BTW - I found this thread in the Forums section. It appears that one
of the main developers just joined the Army for a year?!?

http://www.metamacro.com/awezoom/skale/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=950

That could mean less development for sure! ;-)

-->><<--__-->><<--

 And there's the Avid/Softimage/SGI/IRIX connection... I'm sure it wouldn't
 be any big deal.

 {I just ran across an ad for Discreet's Smoke 6 for linux, by the way.}


 But they could.


 Probably, but... they could do that anyway. And... The free '98 version
 doesn't seem to have hurt them. They could always release a "common" and
 an "elite" version. Linux people are pretty good about copyrights. They'd
 get their bugs fixed... linux would get a real boost.


 Probably the way things are headed anyway.


 VST's pretty similar... It is the users and small developers that have
 built the bulk of the win/mac software. Once VST support gets a bit more
 complete, I have a feeling linux music will flourish {The platform is
 perfectly suited}. With a few good hosts {a good, commercial keykit
 would be great.} linux folk will have access to all sorts {even more}
 of synths, etc. :} What linux audio needs is more users.

 LADSPA, etc {most linux software} does seem a bit more "hardcore" to me.
 Something that professionals might take a bit more seriously than your
 run of the mill VST reverb. Linux has always struck me that way though
 ...practical, no-nonsense software that does its job properly.

Hi,
   I run across this problem a lot in Linux. Maybe someone can help me
make my Gentoo system do audio better. All the straight Alsa stuff works
well. However, when I'm browsing around I come to web sites that
probably want to play some audio, but this is Linux and Alsa, so things
don't work easily. At the web site

http://www.skale.org

I start getting this repeating glitch noise every 8 seconds or so. It
hasn't happened every time I've visited the site today, but it's
happened a lot of times.

   In hdspmixer I see this glitch on all 26 playback channels, by the
way, so I'm assuming that this means it's some sort of OSS problem, but
I'm not sure.

   What's wrong with my setup of Alsa, which in most other ways works
just fine, and why can I also not get mp3 (well, really xmms) to work
under Linux?

   BTW - much non-Alsa audio from Games works fine, but also drives all
26 playback channels. Should it really work this way?

Thanks,
Mark

Frank,
Yes, I had done that much under Gentoo before I wrote back, and it ran,
but then complained the the default skins file was corrupted and quit.

Who knows, maybe it was corrupted? I guess I could download it again and
start over. Do you use unrar to extract the files? Or do you have
another good app for doing that?

Thanks,
Mark

I am using artsd as sound server.
It requires that programs that will try to write directly to /dev/dsp, 
be run with artsdsp.
To solve that problem I modified the mozilla shell script to add artsdsp.
Now it read like this:  ( at the end of /usr/bin/mozilla)

  exec artsdsp $MOZILLA $*


Then, restart mozilla.

Hallo Mark,


No, I just use unrar 3.00 (beta 7). Rar normally has a checksum
algorithm, so it shouldn't have unpacked a corrupt file, but who
knows...

What NVidia do is they have a core binary dirver (cross platform)
and the linux interface part of it is "open source", for some value of
open. This works well, and though I'd rather have propper Free Software 
drivers the NVIDIA drivers have been very relaible on the whole, the 
installation easy and the support from the developers has been good too.
 

Hmm... the TDM DSP chips are as much a part of the hardware platform as
the i/o hardware. IIUC it gives the devleopers copy protection and digi 
plugins that cant be used without thier hardware.

Hi,

I am trying out a small project whereby I wanna transform my gentoo linux
box (2.4.20-r5) into a linux dj rig. So far I have catalogued the bpms of
all my mp3s
with bpmdj, have an external mixer, but where I have hit a snag is
configguring my system to see my 2 sound cards. My "primary" unit is
an SB LIve and it runs smoothly under alsa. My second unit was initially
an Aureal Vortex unit but the alsa drivers weren;t as "easy" to get going
as the ones for an old SB Ensoniq 1370 that I had so I threw it in
instead. And duly recopiled alsa with supoprt for both.

I made changes to the /etc/modules.d/alsa, in the hope of getting devfs to
create new nodes for the device...such as a second dsp and mixer....but as
usual devfs is being a b*()*$ ..... does anyone know how I can get around
my problems....or can anyone who has succesfullys set-up more than one
soundcard in the same box give me any suggestons.

Cheers

Simon

I donwloaded skel tracker, but it comes as a RAR archive.
In case you do not have how to extract files from it, i found a linux 
rar archhiver at http://www.rarsoft.com/download.htm




-->><<--__-->><<--


These are old, OSS.  They did work with the 9652 at one time, nicely in
fact with a graphical panel for clock, etc :)

For now, though, I would work on updating alsa or solving the firmware
issue (downgrade?).  I am building 0.9.6/cvs rpm's based on Fernando's
.spec today and will post a link and info if I get some time.

OK, and that's cool, but what's the solution for Alsa/OSS?

I guess I must be missing your point.

Thanks,
Mark

Could you please send the output of the dmesg command ?

Frank,
   I'm guessing that the RH binary is just not perfectly happy on
Gentoo. I'm trying to get it installed on my Planet CCRMA box, but I
cannot find an RPM version of unrar yet for that platform. It doesn't
seem to show up in Synaptic for the Planet, so I'm wandering around the
web looking.

Cheers,
Mark

Hi Frank,
   Same problem under Redhat as Gentoo unfortunately. I download the
SkaleTracker RAR file using Mozilla. I then run 

unrar t  Skale076wFixed.rar

and it tells me exerything is OK, so I run 

unrar e  Skale076wFixed.rar

and it extracts. I then made it executable 

-rwxr-xr-x    1 mark     mark       673375 Sep 17 00:18
Sk-AvoRINhI4YlV2Ok9j3fZIg@public.gmane.org


and try running it, but I get:

bash-2.05b$ ./Sk\@le076wFixed.rh9 
This is the first version running under Linux. Maybe it's useless by now
because there are important details that could make to run slow the
program under some machines, I hope to resolve them in the next release;
with this version I hope to get enought info to make this Linux version
stable and usefull.

This program is FREE

Until version 1.0 some features has been disabled and other ones are
incomplete.
This is a BETA version. Use it at your own risk.

Default skin file corrupted

bash-2.05b$ 

There was a post to this effect on their forums, but it had no answer to
the problem other than to try downloading again, which I did.

I'll keep thrashing around a bit. Maybe there's a path to getting a new
default skins file somewhere. I might have seen that somewhere.

Cheers,
Mark




-->><<--__-->><<--
Hallo,


I get the same message if I mv the Default skin away. Maybe it is
indeed corrupted. It's quite a large file with about 24 MB. Here's my
checksum of it:

$ md5sum Default.sks 
5b9f59137ab2aa3783c3a1856863df15  Default.sks

ciao

n and
I run it by the way of putting each file listed in the Sk-6caTSLOL/w8@public.gmane.org to his

Sorry for my bad english as always..

Hi

I used to have Mandrake 9.1 on my laptop but after having problems with my USB-audiocard I switched to Debian/Unstable. This solved the usb-audio issues but now I cannot run gdam anymore. It compiles fine (the cvs-version), I can start it up, but as soon as I launch one of the apps (like the "wheels"), it segfaults. Anyone experiencing the same problem? Or, better, knowing a way to solve this problem? 

thx in advance

bash-2.05b$ md5sum Default.sks 
5b9f59137ab2aa3783c3a1856863df15  Default.sks
bash-2.05b$ 

I get the same value, I think.

I'm thinking that my Sk-037d6ggoF0/w1UTkEtfI0w@public.gmane.org file may have some problems. The
file itself looks like it needs to go through dos2unix or something. I
see lots of ^M's at the end of lines. Did you get that from unrar?

<SNIP>
[ Skale Tracker Config File ]^M
^M
If a line starts with # means that it's a config option. The config
options are:^M
^M
        FORCE_TO_BLIT                                           Uses a
blit from the backbuffer to the frontbuffer.
 Else a flip operation is used when posible (fullscreen)^M
<SNIP>

In what directory did you uncompress and place everything? Is it in your
path? My directory is not in my path. Did you edit this config file at
all?

Thanks,
Mark

As far as I can see ALSA are just the sound driver.  It does not have a 
sound server.
IN my Red Hat 9 box, the sound server artds has an option -a that is 
supposed to accept alsa, oss and toss as parameters.  But, artds -A 
shows that valid options are only oss, toss and null.
So, I set it to run with -a toss ( prerefences -> Sound -> Sound  server).
As long as I can hear music I am sure the Alsa drivers are working.
I would  like to know if working with artsd is ok or I should wswitch to 
jack or esd.

Yeah... I tried using the RME firmware update app on windows... but it did nothing to get get from 50 down to 11, even after a complete shutdown and power-off.  I haven't even found 50 listed on the RME website as something that exists... but I sent a message to george@xvisionaudio, who is listed as an RME support person, so I might get a message on Monday.  Anyway, hopefully the new alsa drivers will have a viable update.

Yes, this was the sort of strategy I was thinking of. However, now we
have to figure out why DigiDesign would go to the trouble. Obviously
every machine needs a graphics adapter, so NVidea isn't going to give
away the whole Linux market to ATI. Obviously (I guess) they think they
have somethign to protect from ATI since ATI does (I think) release
source, correct?

In the case of Pro Tools, the question is 'How many customers does
DigiDesign lose to someone else because they don't have a Linux
solution'? I think today that the numbers are very small, but arguably
growing. When will it make a financial difference to DigiDesign's
financial bottom line to support us? 


True, but they still have copy protection to even stop them from
loading. But beyond that, host based processing solutions like RTAS are
required for the smaller 001/002 environments which compete with
Cubase/Nuendo/Sonar, etc. I was thinking all of your work is more in
that host based processing space.

You can do it in ardour too. It's not quite as simple but it is not that
difficult either.

Jesse posted a short list of things you need to do and has said he will
incorporate better functionality in the 1.0 version.

If you need more precise help send to ardour-users and we will try to
explain the process more thoroughly.

What is the error? Can you start it up? Are you using the alsa driver or
the oss driver?

No, but the hdsp only has one subdevice IIUC and the oss emulation
probably onpens the subdevice for writing. You should let the alsa
developer sknow that this is happening so they can make a work around
for devices like yours or fix the driver.

Most people don' use an hdsp for playing games on anyhow. It's common to
have a consumer card for that as hw:0 and the pro cards as hw:1 hw:2 ...

Hello all,

Kevin E. helped me out with my HDSP.  Turns out I just needed the new 0.9.6 drivers (sure took some work to get them up and running, though - thanks, Kevin).  Works great now, with hdspmixer and everything (LOOKS great, too!)....  but one weird thing happens - when I run aplay or play, when it gets to the end of the file something happens and then no programs can access the soundcard.  Something similar happens on windows, but I don't know what's causing it.  Any ideas?

Matt

Hey... very nice. I downloaded it and it works well.

By the way, I used Timidity to "batch convert" the .mid's to .wav's. The 
following was a post to the Timidity User page that explains it...

===========================================
<SNIP>
If you give timidity a playlist, or a wildcard, it will play every midi 
file in
the file list.  If it is writing to wav files, it will automatically
generate the output name for the wav file based on the name of the input
file.  So, to convert all the midi in a directory into wav files:
timidity -Ow1S -s 44100 *.mid
<SNIP>

To be honest I doubt it ever will. There is no significiant feature or
reliability difference between OSX and Linux and the cost of the machine
is small compared to the cost the the digi hardware.

I guess if they (or someone else) wanted to sell pre configured protools
boxes, then linux would save them a few quid in licencing costs, but I
dont think thats a good enough reason.

FWIW ATI dont release source for linux, but they do release (most of) the
specs needed to write a driver.

When using a RME Hammerfall DSP card (like in my case the pci interface
together with a multiface) the 'hdsploader' program from Thomas Charbonnel
is used to load the firmware into the card (that's what the README says).

I am not really sure if I do understand correctly what this means.
Would someone who really knows be so kind and correct me if I am wrong.

AFAIK hdsploader must be called once after booting the hardware and
after loading the snd-hdsp module. Without that snd-hdsp cannot work.
Right?

There is firmware on the RME website. I guess this firmware is *not* the
same as the one hdsploader loads into the card.  I guess, the RME firmware
is burnt into FLASH memory of either the interface card (pci or cardbus)
or the soundcard (digiface, multiface) or maybe both, while the firmware
hdsploader cares about seems to be stored in RAM of the soundcard (and/or
interface).  Is this correct?

Thanks a lot for helping me to understand,

Naturally.... but speaking as someone who created a fair amount 
of material in Buzz, which had a similar license but then the 
author lost the original source code so there'll never be a new

just as soon avoid that sort of experience again.  It's not like 
there's a shortage of "DOS-like" trackers for Linux already....

Just to be thorough for others helping Matt out further, I gave him a
fresh batch of ALSA rpm's, made from CVS yesterday, I called them
0.9.6.cvs (the cvs date is in the spec).  Anyway, once we got those
installed, the HDSP came right up (with only the continuing play
problem Matt mentioned).

Kevin






-->><<--__-->><<--

Kevin,
   Did your RPM's include Thomas's patches sent to this list on or around
the 27th of August? If not it might be helpful to do so. I do not
specifically know if these effected the MultiFace/DigiFace products, but
they were critical for the HDSP 9652.

Mark

Matt,
   When you finish using aplay, is it gone from the process stack when you
do a ps aux? If not, it is probably blocking other apps from getting to the
sound card. If it is gone, then I don't have any idea what's going on.

Sorry, I seem to have officially hijacked this thread without intending

I'll check on the patch, but perhaps it was already in CVS as of

Kevin,
   Thomas is in the process of moving, and not always connected to the net.
The patch, while completely functional, is not as complete as he wanted it
to be. The last time I spoke with him about this he had not committed it to
CVS.

   This data could be out of date, but you may or may not hear from Thomas
for a while and I didn't want you to wait around for an answer that may
possibly not be coming very quickly.

I guess, but I'm not the smartest guy, so help me struggle through. Thomas
built me a special Gentoo ebuild for applying this patch to CVS. I presume
the ebuild might tell me where the patch is? If so, I'll send you a copy off

Would the ebuild help you at all? I assume not if you are building RPMs, but

I think so. The date is right, and I've only heard about one patch,
other than the HDSO 9632 stuff he's working on. There's also a newer
version of hdspmixer (Rev 1.3) that is required to get all the features
from the HDSP 9652, but I don't think it's necessarily required for the
DigiFace or MultiFace.

there seem to be a few of us working on very similar setups all at once :)

I saved this ebuild just in case, as well as the patch in that email strain.  
But I haven't the foggiest what they are for.  In fact I don't even know what 
to ask :)

The status of my setup right now is, I'm going through the planet ccrma steps, 
and have done them all.  all seems well, except for no sound test was heard 
upon exiting alsaconf (this didn't worry me), and aplay didn't play back 
anything.  so I tried some other apps, including hydrogen, and ardour.  
things that were playing back before I switched soundcards and some other 
hardware and did a full reinstall of red hat 9.  those apps run along 
happily, but no output anywhere.  I'm using a hdsp 9652, no multiface.  I'm 
running the optical outputs to a Behringer DDX3216 digital mix console.  I 
know the optical ins work there, because I did some mixing using that and a 
darwin (with ADAT light pipe card)...

for a newbie like me, is there some sort of step by step somewhere that I 
should go through first?  (I plan documenting my steps just in case there's 
not).  It seems that with this card, there are steps missing from the planet 
ccrma instructions - is this right?

ps:
there is a drivers CD included with the card - it has a linux directory, but 
they appear to be OSS drivers - I was planning to avoid them, since my whole 
goal is an ardour system, and that will have to use alsa.  am I right to do 
this?

Aaron,
   Don't mess with it. Just stick with the Planet CCRMA flow. Fernando
will update Alsa from CVS as soon as the patch is committed. For now the
patch is in a testing phase, and I'm not even sure that it effects your
hardware. I needed it because I'm one of a very using using the HDSP

card and a Planet box with a Hammerfall - in case you're confused about
why I'm saying all of this.

Cheers,

-->><<--__-->><<--


Ah, please excuse my other email!


In this case you do want the patch, as far as my experience goes. Make
sure you are on firmware revision 65. You'll have to figure out how to
get it applied to the Alsa source code tree that Fernando supplies
though. That's beyond me.

You'll also want the hdspmixer rev 1.3 that Thomas was speaking of.


I think that this card will not, unfortunately, work with the current
Planet CCRMA Alsa rpm. It doesn't have anything to do with the
instructions. It's just that Alsa doesn't have all the stuff you need
yet. 

I'm sure that's disappointing. All I can offer is that I waited 5 months
to get it working, and switched this box to Gentoo to make building from
source more accessible for me. The Planet flow doesn't really work that
way, unless you can build your own RPMs, or unless Kevin's RPM will work
for you and not upset Fernando's flow. 

I'm sure Fernando will get you something pretty soon.

Yes, avoid them. Stick with firmware rev 65, Alsa 0.9.6 + patch & 
hdspmixer rev 1.3 or higher.

You can skip hdspmixer if you're up for running a few aconnect commands.
That will work too.

Yes. Unless you have another sound card since JACK is using the first one
already.

Not THAT disappointing, as I want to learn as much as I can, as well.  So
any time something goes right, I love it because I can move forward, and
anytime it doesn't, I love it because I'm trying to learn.  In fact I'm
thinking of working this project into a new degree program. :)

I'll go forward, and try and get it humming.  Fernando will probably beat me
to the punch *laugh*

I'm not averse to anything, even writing code.  Writing code will be a HUGE
stretch, as I haven't programmed anything since first year CS courses in -
jeeze '95 or something. :)  That said, I don't want it to be a hack job :)

That's strange, I got my EMI 2|6 USB sound card working fine on a stock
Mandrake 9.1 installation on a Compaq motherboard. This was two days ago.
Plugged it in and played an .ogg file through xmms as the test.

Or possibly Fernando has instructions around on how to patch his source.
If so, then you could take those instructions and Thomas's patch and
somehow make it work.

This is the problem with RPM flows. It's 100% or nothing, pretty much.

Hi all!

I'm searching for a good place for Red Hat ALSA RPMs.
I'm convincend there are many. But is there an "official"
web site ? I know Red Hat doesn't ship ALSA on CD.
But I read about a so-called "Red Hat community".
(Unfortunately, I'm not familar with the Red Hat
package policy.)

Can anybody give a hint?

They also have iso images if you don't have a decent connection handy.
I'll never thank enough Fernando (the guy who is behind this wonderful

Hi,

Sorry for the delay, as Mark said I'm offline most of the time these days.

To make tings clear, here's the status of the driver :

* Alsa 0.9.6 :

Multiface and Digiface work, except for rev 0x32 pci cards (once again 
the patch to make those card work is trivial).
Hdsp 9652 is broken
Hdsp 9632 is unimplemented

* Alsa cvs :

Rev 0x32 mf/df are supported
Hdsp 9652 still broken
Hdsp 9632 still unimplemented

* Not even in cvs :

Multiface, Digiface (all firmwre revisions) and hdsp 9652 (rev. 101 at 
least) are supported (patch posted on alsa-dev)
Hdsp 9632 is supported.
BUT the hwdep ioctl interface has changed hence this version is 
incompatible with the current hdspmixer and hdspconf. I have working 
versions for mf/df and 9652 but I still have to add hdsp 9632 support to 
those tools. I hope to find the time to to this by the end of the week, 
and bring all this to cvs.

Thomas




-->><<--__-->><<--

Yes, you are correct.
We use the word 'firmware' in two cases :
1) to designate the flashable onboard firmware of the hdsp cards, which
determines the card revision.
2) (improperly) to designate the configuration data that needs to be 
uploaded into external IO boxes (Multiface and Digiface) using hdsploader.

Thomas




-->><<--__-->><<--




Actually, I prefer Debian (I've been running it on my my desktop for 
some years now). I only installed Mandrake at the the time because it 
came with XFree 4.3. So, I'd rather someone could enlighten me on 
fixing the problem within Debian (it's unstable that I'm running; maybe 
it's just too much up-to-date).

cheers

-->><<--__-->><<--

Thomas - please verify:

* Alsa 0.9.6 + Aug. 27th patch
MultiFace & DigiFace work, except for rev 0x32 pci cards
HDSP 9652 works for rev 101 (0x65)
HDSP 9632 is broken

The group requires hdspmixer rev 1.3





-->><<--__-->><<--

Mark, Thomas etc.: If there is now a driver
for HDSP 9652, rev 101, we would really like to
know if this has been tested running continuously
for a day or more, with a CPU-intensive application
such as PD with a big patch.

The experience we have had, trying to make this work
for about half a year now with previous drivers and
versions of firmware, is that the whole machine
freezes totally after a few hours of operation, which
is disastrous for us. All kinds of kernels, drivers,
motherboards, BIOS settings etc. give the same problem -
believe me we have tried absolutely everything.

So, has long-term stability at relatively high CPU
loads (30-40%) and substantial disk activity been tested
for the new driver and 101 firmware? We are happy to
accept xruns and whatever, as long as the machine doesn't
crash!


Thanks, and in desperate hope,

There is.


Not by me, but I'd be very interested in trying out something like this for
you if it would help advance things.


My Linux system that uses the HDSP 9652 has turned out to be a much
different usage model than what I thought it was going to be when I bought
the card. Like you, I envisioned that I would be using lots of Linux apps
and using lots of compute cycles. For me this hasn't been the case as the
apps cannot yet replace the Windows apps I use today. (I remain vigilant and
will pounce when they can!) In my project studio environment the card is
primarily an audio router hooking together a number other computers and
hardware:

(Please excuse my remedial ASCSI art, and I hope I made the lines small
enough not to break.)

                      --------------------

Sometimes the GigaStudio machine runs Planet CCRMA Redhat and I use Linux
apps there.

In the above configuration the primary job of the HDSP 9652 is to route
audio from machine to machine. All of this can be done in the HDSP card
itself. I do not even have to run Jack to make this part work. At this point
the machine is very stable. This has been up for about a month (since Thomas
got the driver operating) and has run for many hours at a time without a
crash I would associate with anything audio oriented. However, this only
uses about 1% of the CPU and requires no disk access.

I do, however, run Jack and some Jack apps mostly as processors for audio
coming from the other PCs and hardware, as well as a couple of Linux soft
synths. (ZynAdSubFX and amSynth) I want very much to do some work with AMS
and SSM but haven't had the time.

I'd be very interested in trying PD with whatever patches you might want to
use as a test. I know very little about PD and would be interested in
learning more, as well as seeing what reliability issues might arise. I'm
good at debugging hardware related stuff, but not so good at Linux software,
so there would likely be considerable interaction if we did this.


Cheers,
Mark

Does anyone know if the ADC 0 and ADC 1 controls on envy24control
actually control the preamp gain on the M-Audio Delta 1010LT or would
it just be the AD converter levels?

My eventual goal is to use my DAW as a PA processor for small road
gigs using Freqtweak or something similar for the master EQ and
dynamics processing for FOH and monitors.  As a proof of concept I
connected the XLR outputs of an Allen & Heath console to the XLR
inputs of my Delta 1010LT and connected the outputs of the Delta
1010LT to the power amp.  I was not able to get good levels without
distortion and I suspect it is because I need to decrease the gain on
the mic preamps in the 1010LT.  I would've connected to the
line-level RCA inputs, but I didn't have a cable handy to try that.  

The problem seemed to persist even if I lowered the faders on the
console.  So does the preamp gain sound suspicious or am I connecting
something with too much of an output level to a mic preamp to begin
with or does it seem like something else?  I'm pretty sure I'm not
driving the amps with too much level frin the DAW.

Any help is greatly appreciated.
Greg







-->><<--__-->><<--
ah ha.

i have a lame question - what is CVS?  I see alsa 0.9.6 and alsa cvs - those
aren't seperate and distinct driver packages are they?  I'm confused.

I don't have any answers to your real question, but I just want
to warn you off from using FreqTweak as your EQ for a PA.  I'm
sure if you were careful it might be possible, but that tool
is really intended for freakish audio damage, rather than proper
reinforcement :)   

Try some of Steve's LADSPA plugins (multiband EQ, 3 band
parametric, SC1/2/3/4),  or use Jamin, which has both EQ and dynamics built in, 
and that EQ is actually much more transparent and linear.

Also, if you are using any of this for live performance or monitoring,
latency is going to be a *big* issue for you.  You'll find that
for live instruments, you probably won't be satisfied with buffer
sizes much bigger than 64 or 128, which can be hard to maintain
without a perfectly tuned system.  But then again, maybe your
material is not latency sensitive......

jlc





-->><<--__-->><<--
I can tell you that there are old fashioned physical jumpers on the Delta 
1010LT card that you are supposed to set one way for line-level and another 
way for mic-level input. One set of jumpers for each of the two lines that 
have mic pre-amps on board.





-->><<--__-->><<--

Wow, you won't find that kind of honesty in the commercial world :-) 
I appreciate the warning.  I've actually used it as an EQ for
non-realtime stuff with decent results, but I haven't decided whether
it's what I really want for this purpose.


I haven't used Jamin at all and I've only used Steve's stuff just a
little.  The thing I liked about Freqtweak was resolution.  With 256
bands using only the boost and cut modules I had the resolution I
needed to make surgical changes.  What I'd really like that I haven't
seen yet is a 31-band 1/3-octave EQ that works something like
Freqtweak with the spectral analysis and drawing curves and whatnot.


I haven't had a problem with it yet.  I did some tests with a
microphone and had my Jack latency set to @5ms and I didn't see any
noticable Freqtweak latency.  I was using the boost and cut modules
only with the lowest max delay setting (not really sure what that's
for yet) and 256 bands of EQ and I couldn't tell a noticable latency.
 I don't think the people I play with/mix for would either.  My
computer is an AthlonXP 2400 so it's relatively fast.


I can't imagine that :-)

I'm not sure I'm ready to introduce this idea yet, (certainly not in
this thread) but I've been thinking about building a system that will
be stable and reliable enough to be a PA processor -- sort of like a
Driverack or something.  I was thinking about using the processing
engine of Freqtweak and writing a GUI (or not) to control it that
would run separately.  I envisioned the processing engine running as
a service so if the computer crashed it could be brought back up
without having to manually start and set everything and if the GUI
crashed the engine would still be running.  I even thought about the
possibility of running the "controller" on a separate computer so the
processing box could be just a text-based Linux with nothing but
audio on it.  

Eventually I'd like this to lead to a real-time live mixing
environment where my "console" was just a control surface.  The
routing and processing options available in the digital domain are
just too cool to pass up.

I've been taking a hard look at Freqtweak, both to learn the
environment and to see if it does some of what I'm looking for.  I
plan to look at other packages too, just haven't gotten there yet.

Greg




-->><<--__-->><<--

I've wanted to build something like this for several years.  It sounds like
we've toyed with some similar design ideas.  Let me know if you ever get
started with this project, I'd like very much to be involved.  I'll probably
start such a project myself in a few years if nobody else does, but I don't
feel ready to tackle it yet.

-->><<--__-->><<--
You're right, just like it says in the manual :-)

Sorry.
Greg






-->><<--__-->><<--

You want JAMin then. You can edit its curve using a 31-band, hand
draw, or using parametric style widgets. The are two spectrum views, 1/3
octave bands and continuous.

The latency is probably higher than freqtweak though. If you reduce the
limiter release time to its minimum it will be 5.3ms @ 48kHz.

- Steve 



-->><<--__-->><<--


I assume you mean 5.3ms on top of the 5ms of my Jack setup?

Greg




-->><<--__-->><<--
I know of at least one system like this.  I can't remember the name
and I don't know what OS it uses, but I suspect it's Windows.  A
local auditorium uses it.  It provides EQ, dynamics processing, delay
lines, and routing.  They use it for all their FOH and monitor
processing, sending a delayed signal to the balcony, and several
signals to the green room and other places in the building.  I
believe it can be controlled via LAN as well.  I haven't seen the
user interface, but I have seen the rack.  There may be other
hardware involved besides just the computer.

I hope to not wait a few years b/c I need EQ's and compressors right
now and can't afford to go buy them and don't have the space to store
them.  So I'll probably be throwing some code out over the next few
months and if it sucks, I'm sure everyone will let me know :-)

Greg






-->><<--__-->><<--

Hmm. I'd be very careful of latency in a live performance for the mains
or especially the monitors. 5 ms is roughly equivalent to moving
your monitors 5 feet farther away.  This might be a problem on
a big stage where things are already pretty kooky.  Or maybe not -
I haven't tried :-)  I'm very curious to hear if it works for you.

-->><<--__-->><<--

So it sounds like this is a fixed latency -- meaning that Jamin is
doing some buffering of its own on top of Jack.  Is that the case in
most apps of this nature like Freqtweak?  Is it just not possible to
do this kind of processing without additional buffering?

I'm sure a closer look at the code will answer some of these
questions, but I was just wondering.

Greg




-->><<--__-->><<--


Part of my problem is that I rarely work with stages that big.  Our
wedges are right at the mics.  So even if I built a system that
worked in my typical environment it might not scale up to larger
sound stages, etc.  And it might not be affordable enough for the
small-time guy like me to get into it.  I mean, even if the software
is free, you could buy some good EQ's with the money you'd spend on a
decent computer system.  I suppose there are other advantages.

CVS Means Concurrent Versions System.

DESCRIPTION
  CVS is a version control system, which allows you to keep old 
versions         of  files  (usually  source  code),  keep  a  log of 
who, when, and why        changes occurred, etc., like RCS or SCCS. 
Unlike the simpler  systems,        CVS  does  not just operate on one 
file at a time or one directory at a        time, but operates on 
hierarchical collections of directories consisting  of  version 
controlled files.  CVS helps to manage releases and to        control 
the concurrent editing of source files among multiple  authors.
CVS  allows triggers to enable/log/control various operations and works
well over a wide area network.

Type: man cvs for more information.

With CVS you can get from a remote server just those files that  have 
been updated lately so your local source code copy will be up to date.

This would be trivial to assemble with jack-rack and a few plugins, or pd if

pd can be controlled over ethernet with OSC, and jack-rack with DMIDI.

More or less, yes.


Freqtweak and JAMin both use the FFT algorithm, its not possible* to run
it without additional latency.

* Actually thats not true, its just far too expensive to run it at very
  low latencies. halving the latency doubles the cpu cost, and it only
  works to a point.

my two questions are hopefully simple - how do I do that?  and can I go back 
up later?  (I imagine Thomas and company will have the drivers humming for 
the newer rev and that at that point it'd be a good idea to go back up - if 
possible)

also, I know this has been explained three times in the last day to other 
people asking, but this is not actual "firmware" in the sense that it's some 
kind of flash happening to the hardware, right?  I think the one post 
explained that we were actually calling this firmware erroneously...

You put the card in a Windows based (or maybe Mac based, I don't know)
computer and you run the firmware updater for the Rev 101 (65 hex) firmware.
It takes the card down to rev 101. This is available on the RME web site
under downloads.


Yep. You run the Rev 104 (hex 68) updater to do that.
I've done this process 10 times anyway.


I would like to as I cannot get all the Windows based tools from RME for the
101 firmware revision.


Not in the HDSP 9652. In this case it really is firmware. I think in the
case of the DigiFace/MultiFace it is not except it's as good a term as any
so we continue to use it.

run it and find out! ;-)

It is a configuration tool for all the HDSP cards. (DF/MF/HDSP 9652/9632)




-->><<--__-->><<--

I do not know how to apply the patch to a Planet flow box. I have placed the
HDSP 9652 in a Gentoo box as it's easier to patch Gentoo, which is source
code based, than a Planet box, which is RPM based.

However, Kevin Ernste was building Alsa RPMs. If you could talk him into
patching his source and then building the RPM you would just install that
RPM on your Planet box and be done. I think that's the best solution, but I
don't know how to do any of it myself. (I'm a dumb end-user type...) ;-)

Kevin responded to you yesterday.

[Fernando _is_ in the room, but...]

**Fernando looks around seemingly confused and says "who? me?"**

I've been following this thread and I'm interested in getting a newer
more hdsp friendly rpm set done. I'm waiting a bit for the dust to
settle. One problem is that I don't have enough time to read all the
posts in _detail_ so I'm not sure what is current and what/where are the
patches. I'm using the newest (about to be released officially) Planet
CCRMA alsa packages with a Digiface... really cool hdspmixer and all
that. I guess completely obsolete versions by now. 

Creating new rpms with a patch is not too difficult but I really really
don't have the time right now for a tutorial... [back to trying to
release the latest kernel and alsa packages]

Hello,

Is there any ready to use sampler for linux/alsa?
I would realy love to use shaketracker with a sampler
to acheve usual tracker functionality.
(No, although cheesetracker is perfect, I very very want midi too)
I don't need gig or halion support or even sf2 
just plain .wav sampler.

-->><<--__-->><<--


In the case of the rpm's I built originally for Matt B, I used
Fernando's .spec files from the Planet src.rpms, editing them to point
to the more recent CVS sources I had downloaded, also cleaning out
references to patches which were no longer relavent.  In this case you
could simply add an entry for the new patch in the spec, you will see
others there as syntax examplees.  

Once you have the spec edited (in /usr/src/redhat/SPEC) and the sources
and patches in the right place (/usr/src/redhat/SOURCES), you should,
ideally, be able to just rebuild.

More info on that can be sound here:

http://ccrma-www.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/recompilealsa.html

Kevin




-->><<--__-->><<--

Sorry to be behind on messages here, long two teaching days.  I just
dropped a note to Aaron, and I would be more than happy to help further
if I can.  

It looks like Fernando may have trumped us all and released new rpms
today, so perhaps I'll see about patching those (has anyone tested them
yet, perhaps the problem is already solved?).  That should gaguarantee
compatibility, thus preserving your planet "chi" :)

Kevin




-->><<--__-->><<--

Probably not :-) 
The rpms (0.9.6-2.cvs) are based on CVS from 20030825.181154. 

_If_ the patches you are all so fired up about :-) are in current CVS I
could try building it and putting it in the planetedge repository. 

-- Fernando





-->><<--__-->><<--


I think the easiest solution that I have found was to take smurf or
swami and create sf2 files out the .wav's.  It is pretty simple once you
learn how to use smurf.  Then you save it then open it with fluidsynth.
An easy solution would be to load Muse -R then load the softsynth
fluidsynth and then load the soundfont you created in Smurf or Swami.
Then select a track, hit the arm button, choose fluidsynth in instrument
selection, and then play away. 

fluidsynth no longer requires and soundfont compatible card.

No, I don't they are that out of date actually. If you add Thomas's
patch then Planet users would get HDSP 9652 support. If you packaged
hdspmixer rev 1.3 somewhere, then HDSP 9652 Planet user would get a
mixer. That's a nice step forward

What you do *not* get with the patch is a solution for HDSP 9632 users,
of which I believe you have at least one. A solution for that should be
in CVS at week's end, whenever that is, if Thomas manages to get it
done.

I think you should wait for that as it's really only a few days away,
unless Thomas pops up and says he's not going to get that into CVS then,
or on whatever time schedule you want to apply that patch, etc.

My only issue with this work Thomas is doing is that it will a new
version of the code that I haven't tested (as far as I know) and there
may be some debug that comes up, where as Alsa 0.9.6 + the patch I've
been using for a month now.

Unless I'm needed for something, I'm going to check out of this thread
now as it's about a Planet RPM which I won't be able to use since this
card is under Gentoo for me. (I'll probably check back in on the Planet
side about the little Hammerfall Light driver bug I found though...) ;-)

What kind of sampler do you look for?

How about 'Simsam'? (Simple Sampler)

http://simsam.sourceforge.net/




-->><<--__-->><<--

It looks like they got something that could be pretty good soon. I like
to assign a wav file to a range of keys rather than just one key. Makes
me wish I knew c++ really well. I could modify it to just how I like it.
All that it needs is a way to map across a range of keys.

 What would be nice is something crossplatform that would allow one to
 write sample catalogs in a common, standardized format, to cd ...as well
 as tracking them, indexing them {cds as well}, converting samples, writing
 compressed cd images for easy library publication, etc... Maybe it could
 use ogg or something... maybe have an online sample collection along the
 lines of debian and planet ccrma}

 {oh... actually playing them might be a function as well. :}}

 Is there like a "common desktop" sort of organization for linux audio?

Thanks, again (can we ever thank you enough, Fernando?).  Here's the
Aug 27th patch that seems to be the point of interest, linked from a
correspondence on Alsa-devel.

this helps a bunch - it looks like fernando's gonna beat me to it, which is

(I may have to skip a couple lunches and get a couple dummies books to lay
some better foundation)

your time definitely seems better spent developing than writing tutorials -
I'm planning at LEAST on documenting the steps I took, once I get humming,
and hopefully I can generalize enough to add something to the general

can do some good tutorials (I dunno that may be a longer term goal than I

Dear music enthousiasts,


LilyPond version 2.0 was released today. LilyPond is an automated
music notation system: it is used to make gorgeous sheet music.  It is
libre software ("open source"), and available for most Unix flavors,
including Linux and MacOS X, and MS Windows.

Use it for your music too!

For this version, we have dramatically simplified many parts of the
syntax, making it easier to use than ever before.  Other improvements
include quarter-tone accidentals, and conditional inclusion of music
fragments. With version 2.0, we have a solid platform for working on
notation and typography features for coming versions.

Downloads, examples and documentation are available from the website,

	http://lilypond.org

A big thank-you goes out to our hackers and bughunters: Mats
Bengtsson, Heikki Junes, Juergen Reuter, Antonio Palama, Benjamin
Milde, Daniel Berjon Diez, David Bobroff, David Rayleigh Arnold, Erik
Ronstroem, Fabio dos Santos, Fodor Bertalan, Frederic Bron, Graham
Parcival, Ian Bailey-Mortimer, John Williams, Josza Marton, Marco
Caliari, Matthieu Amiguet, Michael Welsh Duggan, Patrick Atamaniuk,

Wolvendans, and Werner Trobin


Happy music printing,



Han-Wen Nienhuys & Jan Nieuwenhuizen
(core development team)



New features in 2.0 since 1.8
*****************************

   * Crescendos can now be drawn dotted or dashed.

   * Quarter tones are now supported. They are entered by suffixing
     `ih' for a half-sharp and `eh' for a half-flat. Hence, the
     following is an ascending list of pitches:

            ceses ceseh ces ceh c cih cis cisih cisis

   * The following constructs have been removed from the syntax:

            \duration #SCHEME-DURATION
            \pitch #SCHEME-PITCH
            \outputproperty FUNC SYMBOL = VALUE

     For `\outputproperty', the following may be substituted:

             \applyoutput #(outputproperty-compatibility FUNC
                            SYMBOL VALUE)

   * Clefs may now be transposed arbitrarily, for example

            \clef "G_8"
            \clef "G_15"
            \clef "G_9"

   * The syntax for chords and simultaneous music have changed.  Chords
     are entered as

             <PITCHES>

     while simultaneous music is entered as

             <<..MUSIC LIST..>>

     In effect, the meanings of both have been swapped relative to
     their 1.8 definition.  The syntax for lists in `\markup' has
     changed alongside, but figured bass mode was not  changed, i.e.:

            \markup { \center <..LIST OF MARKUPS..> }
            \figure { <FIGURES> }

     As chords the more often used than simultaneous music, this change
     will save keystrokes.

   * Each music expression can now be tagged, to make different printed
     versions from the same music expression.  In the following example,
     we see two versions of a piece of music, one for the full score,
     and one with cue notes for the instrumental part:

          << \tag #'part <<
              { c4 f2 g4 }      % in the part, we have cue-notes
              \\ R1 >>
            \tag #'score R1  % in the score: only a rest
          >>

     The same can be applied to articulations, texts, etc.: they are
     made by prepending

                  -\tag #YOUR-TAGS

     to an articulation, for example,

                  c4-\tag #'with-fingerings -4 -\tag #'with-strings \6

     This defines a note, which has a conditional fingering and a
     string-number indication.

   * The settings for chord-fingering are more flexible. You can
     specify a list where fingerings may be placed, eg.

          	\property Voice.fingeringOrientations = #'(left down)

     This will put the fingering for the lowest note below the chord,
     and the rest to the left.

   * The script previously known as `ly2dvi' has been renamed to
     `lilypond'. The binary itself is now installed as `lilypond-bin'.

   * Markup text (ie. general text formatting) may now be used for
     lyrics too.

   * Two new commands for grace notes have been added, `\acciaccatura'
     and `\appoggiatura',

            \appoggiatura f8 e4
            \acciaccatura g8 f4

     Both reflect the traditional meanings of acciaccatura and
     appogiatura, and both insert insert a slur from the first grace
     note to the main note.

   * Layout options for grace notes are now stored in a context
     property, and may now be set separately from musical content.

   * The `\new' command will create a context with a unique name
     automatically. Hence, for multi-staff scores, it is no longer
     necessary to invent arbitrary context names. For example, a
     two-staff score may be created by

            \simultaneous {
              \new Staff { NOTES FOR 1ST STAFF }
              \new Staff { NOTES FOR 2ND STAFF }
            }

   * Octave checks make octave errors easier to correct.  The syntax is

            \octave PITCH

     This checks that PITCH (without octave) yields PITCH (with octave)
     in \relative mode. If not, a warning is printed, and the octave is
     corrected.

   * All articulations must now be entered postfix. For example,

          	c8[( d8])

     is a pair of beamed slurred eighth notes.

   * The definition of `\relative' has been simplified.  Octaves are
     now always propagated in the order that music is entered. In the
     following example,

            PRE
            \repeat "unfold" 3  BODY \alternative { ALT1 ALT2 }
            POST

     the octave of BODY is based on PRE, the starting octave of ALT1 on
     BODY, the starting octave of ALT2 on ALT1, and the starting octave
     of POST on ALT2.

     The same mechanism is used for all other music expressions, except
     the chord. Backwards compatibility is retained through a special
     program option, which is set through

            #(ly:set-option 'old-relative)

   * Windows users can double click a `.ly' file to process and view it
     automagically through the new `lily-wins' frontend.


New features in 1.8 since 1.6
*****************************

   * The chord entry code has been completely rewritten. It is now
     cleaner and more flexible.

   * A new syntax has been added for text entry.  This syntax is more
     friendly than the old mechanism, and it is implemented in a more
     robust and modular way. For more information, refer to the section
     on "Text markup" in the notation manual.

   * The integration of the input language and Scheme has been made
     deeper: you can now use LilyPond identifiers in Scheme, and use
     Scheme expressions instead of LilyPond identifiers.

   * The internal representation of music has been cleaned up completely
     and converted to Scheme data structures.  The representation may be
     exported as XML.

   * A new uniform postfix syntax for articulation has been introduced.
     A beamed slurred pair of eighth notes can be entered as

          	c8-[-( d8-]-)

     In version 2.0, postfix syntax will be the only syntax available,
     and the dashes will become optional.

     This will simplify the language: all articulations can be entered
     as postfix, in any order.

   * A new syntax has been added for chords:

          	<< PITCHES >>

     It is not necessary to update files to this syntax, but it will be
     for using LilyPond version 2.0.  In version 2.0, this syntax will
     be changed to

          	< PITCHES >

     for chords, and

          	\simultaneous { .. }

     for simultaneous music.

     To convert your files from <PITCHES> to <<PITCHES>>, use the script
     included in buildscripts/convert-new-chords.py

     This change was introduced for the following reasons

        * It solves the "start score with chord" problem, where you
          have to   state \context Voice explicitly when a chord was
          the start of a   Staff or Score.

        * With the new syntax, it is possible to distinguish between
          articulations (or fingerings) which are for a single chord
          note,   and which are for the entire chord. This allows for
          per-note   fingerings, and is more logical on the whole.

   * User code may now be executed during interpreting.  The syntax for
     this code is

          	\applycontext #SCHEME-FUNCTION

   * User code may now be executed on arbitrary grobs during
     interpreting.  The syntax for this feature is

          	\applyoutput #SCHEME-FUNCTION

     SCHEME-FUNCTION takes a single argument, and is called for every
     grob that is created in the current context.

   * New algorithms for chord-name formatting have been installed. They
     can be tuned and have ergonomic syntax for entering exceptions.

   * Texts may now be put on multimeasure rests, e.g.

          	R1*20^\markup { "GP" }

   * Ancient notation now prints ligatures in Gregorian square neumes
     notation, roughly following the typographical style of the Liber
     hymnarius of Solesmes, published in 1983.  Ligatures are still
     printed without the proper line breaking and horizontal spacing.

   * Glissandi can now be printed using the zigzag style.

   * LilyPond can now print clusters. The syntax is

          	\apply #notes-to-clusters { NOTE NOTE .. }

   * For irregular meters, beat grouping marks can be printed. The
     syntax for this is

          	#(set-time-signature 7 8 '(3 2 2))

   * Nested horizontal brackets for music analysis can now be printed:

          	NOTE-\startGroup
          		..
          	NOTE-\stopGroup

   * Ottava brackets are now fully supported as a feature.  The syntax
     is

          	#(set-octavation 1)

   * Metronome markings are printed when a \tempo command is processed.

   * Fingerings can be put on chords horizontally.

   * The appearance of various glyphs has been fine-tuned.

   * Different types of percent style repeats may now be nested.

   * The emacs support has been extended.

   * The manual has been completely revised and extended.


New features in 1.6 since 1.4
*****************************

   * Support for figured bass and tablature.

   * Completely rewritten beam formatting: provides much better output
     now.

   * Completely revised and improved music font.

   * Completely rewritten MIDI import support.

   * Completely rewritten grace note support. Practically speaking this
     means that grace notes can be slurred to normal normal notes.

   * Improved accidental handling and formatting: styles for producing
     cautionaries may vary, and complex collisions between accidentals
     of a chord are handled much better.

   * Better spacing: both globally and locally. This includes subtle
     details like optical stem spacing.

   * More support for ancient notation: mensural ligatures, ambitus
     (pitch range) of voices, more shapes, etc.

   * More support for piano notation: bracket pedals, directed
     arpeggios, arpeggio brackets.

   * Easier music polyphonic music entry.

   * More extensibility, many speedups and bugfixes

   * The manual has been thoroughly revised.

   * Development is now hosted at http://savannah.gnu.org, and sources
     can be downloaded through anonymous CVS.

   * Support for windows: LilyPond is part of the cygwin distribution,
     which comes with a user-friendly installer.

Hallo,


Ah, okay. You might want to take a look at Pd then, which is a modular
synth and more. Doing such a sample-player in Pd is really easy. If
you need help, I could just build a Pd patch that does this very
quickly. The help file for the readsf~ object would be a good start.
The good thing, is that with Pd (or jMax or SSM) you can build very
personalized samplers and other things *without* knowing C++

Hi again,

Anyone know if the new Tascam US-122 USB audio/midi soundcard is 
supported by the generic USB drivers in Alsa?  

How do we know if anyone is woking on it - the alsa-supported-sound 
card-page hasn't been updated for a while.

Is this the forum to ask?

It seems like a nice cheap solution for me laptop (powered by USB too).

Thanks,

awareness. For example, what can I do with MIDI in pd (I don't mean
controlling pd from a sequencer, but using pd to generate MIDI events)?

I am looking for a kind of sampler 
which would have usual tracker's sampler
functionality.
(as in ScreamTracker, ImpulseTracker,
CheeseTracker)

The main features are: 
*ease of changing samples on the fly*,
*usability*.

In fact I just want the second half of
conventional tracker to use with 
ShakeTracker which is midi sequencer.

The algorithm "swami convert into sf2 save
 load into fluidsynth"
 proposed by Jeremiah Benham is not okay
 this must be done by a couple of 
 mouse clicks [or better keyboard shortcuts].

looks like simsam is something promising.
can't wait until I get to my linux box
and try it.






-->><<--__-->><<--

I am in the process of learning Pd. How is the performance with sample
based synthesis compared to fuidsynth. Fluidsynth runs nice on my pc but
I will not compile on my powerbook because it has bits of x86 assembly
in it. Stange they have it for osX and linux but not ppc linux. 
I currently do alot of sample synth in csounds. Real-time Performance wise can you give me a comparison of sfront, csound, and PD?  Has any body tried to benchmark such things?  I only have a cheesy celeron on my pc now also so I plan to use pd to come up with quick ideas that I may later translate into csounds.  

C/C++ would not be a bad thing to learn though do you think?

Thanks,
Jeremiah





-->><<--__-->><<--

when swami was smurf you could use that as a sample synthesizer in
itself.  I am sure swami can do it also. You might want to try it.  You
can change all kinds of parameters about the soundfont.

Hallo,


I wrote the news item for this on pure-data.org, so you might want to
check there. pure-data.org also is becoming a center for patches,
documentation and more. 

The book is quite theoretic: lots of math and formulas. So be warned ;(
But it also includes deeper explanations of the example patches. 

A nice new project is the "Pd Repertory Project".  It is "an attempt
to make stable, open-source implementations of pieces in the
electronic music repertory". 


Greg Rippin wrote a very interesting master thesis on this topic. See
http://home.nyu.edu/~gmr222/

I've heard that it works if you use the loader from

Ooops, I stupidly forgot to ask what alsa version you were using.
Although support for rev 0x32 card is a trivial 1 line addition to the 
driver code, it isn't part of alsa 0.9.6 yet, you'll have to either 
patch it yourself or use the cvs version of alsa.

One small comment on the dmesg output : in your initial post you pasted 
this lspci output snippet :
01:09.0 Multimedia audio controller: Xilinx Corporation RME Hammerfall 
DSP (rev 32)
I can see no mention of such a PCI device in the dmesg output. Did you 
do anything since then, like changing the card's pci slot ?

Humm... I'm not sure what you mean by "i followed the upper/lower case

I tried moving Sk-AvoRINhI4YlV2Ok9j3fZIg@public.gmane.org, Sk@leLinux.cfg, KeybLinux.cfg, 
Sk-NxhS1+VfSYo@public.gmane.org and Default.sks to a new directory and trying it there, all
to the same end. I just get a message about a corrupted skins file.

I guess I'll post a message in the SkaleTracker forums and see what

Hello all - Aaron here again 

well I promised progress - well I went and read about RPM so I'd know what the 
hell it was, and now am applying patch.  I've got Fernando's kernel and ALSA 
source, and I've put the patch in /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES and edited the alsa 
driver spec file, adding that patch, (I had to manually create the redhat 
directory in /usr/src - it wasn't there and rpm wouldn't create it

and following directions on
http://ccrma-www.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/recompilealsa.html

but I'm getting this wonderful thing:
bash: rpmbuild: command not found

that was quite unexpected.  I'm sure I'll figure this out eventually but I 
thought it'd be smarter and faster to ask - what is happening?  do I have a 
partial RPM in my system?  

# rpm --version     gives me:
RPM version 4.2

well thanks - cya on the flipside!

Hi,

Matt again.  So if you remember I have this problem where my hdsp freezes any time I use play (or any app that utilizes the play program, like maybe (?) audacity...).  When I use play, it plays the soundfile, but afterward, I can't open any programs that would use my soundcard (some open but say it can't find the device or that the device is in use).  When I run "ps aux" there's no indication of play being there.  However, when I run play and it gets to the end of the soundfile, I hear what sounds like an amp clip, and I get this:

/usr/bin/play: line 205:  1686 Segmentation fault      sox $volume $fopts $fopts2 "$filename" $arch_defines $device $effects


The 1686 before the Segmentation fault seems to change depending on the soundfile (1802 is another I've had)... I'm not really sure what that number is.  So I opened up my /usr/bin/play in vi to see what was in line 205 (I've displayed the last bit of the program):

# If name is "rec" then record else assume user is wanting to play
# a sound file.
if [ "$program_name" = "rec" ]; then

    # Don't send data to stdout if they are reading from it.
    if [ "$filename" = "-" ]; then
      echo "Send break (control-c) to end recording" 1>&2
    else
      echo "Send break (control-c) to end recording"
    fi
    sox $volume $arch_defines $fopts $device $fopts2 "$filename" $effects 

else
    sox $volume $fopts $fopts2 "$filename" $arch_defines $device $effects
fi

Line 205 is the final fi, but the line above that is the one that appears in the "error" message I get running play.  Is there something in that line (or the rest of the program) that I should change to get it to work with my hdsp?  I have an onboard nVidia soundcard that works with play just fine, and aplay works fine with both cards.  Is it a problem in the play program, or maybe the alsa hdsp driver I'm using?  Another thing I noticed is that when I use play, the signal is being sent to all the channels on the hdspmixer, whereas when I use aplay, it sends it just to the first two.  What gives?

Also, when this happens, I've been rebooting the machine... is there a way maybe to restart alsa instead?

Thanks,

Matt

I even created an .asoundrc.  I don't know if that helped though.  It

Yes, but the problem is that RME made a mess of their product names, so I do
not know what hardware he is speaking of in this thread.

For the record, I (and Aaron I believe) do not own the 'HDSP', which I think
is the PCI card that works with the DigiFace & MultiFace. (Others might have
a different opinion of what the 'HDSP' is. Maybe it's just an acronym for
the 'Hammerfall DSP' which is only a product line name and not an actual
product.)

I own an HDSP 9652. This problem does sound a bit like my experience with
rev 68 firmware on my HDSP 9652 with the unpatched CVS 0.9.6 driver.

Please, to everyone, try to give the complete name of your hardware as the
solutions for the HDSP 9652 are completely separate from the HDSP/DF/MF
solutions which are completely different from the HDSP 9632 also.

what a mess, 'eh? ;-)

- Mark





-->><<--__-->><<--
yes, I own the HDSP 9652

and I too forgot about this mess - yes, you must tell us which thing you
have.  if you can't quite glean the model numbers, etc., describe the hell
out of it

for example:  the HDSP 9652 is a card with a bunch of optical, spdif, midi
and word clock plugs, it goes in a pci slot, and has no outboard
thingamagics like a multiface or anything

(that's the LEAST technical languaging I think I have EVER used! :) )

I'd like to get an ALSA-compatible sound card (PCI) for an older

replacing an ISA SB16.  Economy is the goal here.  I'm aware of the ALSA 
sound card matrix, but it does not provide list prices for each card, 
nor does it indicate whether a particular card is even on the market. 
Would anyone be willing to offer a recommendation?

Too bad you don't need ISA.  I have an old Gravis Ultrasound Max here with  
midi interface and memory upgrade and everything.  Probably the best consumer- 
grade ISA sound card ever made.  I could have sold it to you very affordably.

Get a card based on the Ensoniq chipsets (1371), they are cheap and

I just discovered something which makes me rather embarrassed at having 
so lazily asked for help.  The hard drive in this machine used to be in 
my newer machine, which had no ISA slots.  Because of this, I'd disabled 
ISA support in my kernel configuration.  Consequently, the SB16 wasn't 
showing up in the list of supported sound cards, since the "ISA Devices" 
ALSA group was being hidden.  I've now enabled ISA support, enabled the 
SND_SB16 module, and am rebuilding my kernel.  Thanks to John, Austin, 
and Vincent, for the replies.  Sorry to have taken your time unnecessarily.

TTFN,

Some applications keeps accessing /dev/dsp.

You can run the following command to see what application is opening 
/dev/dsp:


fuser /dev/dsp*


Read: man fuser.

Run also:

lsof -p ###


Where ### es the process number of an application

Read: man lsof

Hi experts and geniuses.

Please be gentle with a newbie who has been using mandrake linux for a couple 
of years, but has staid clear of recompiling kernels etc, and just been a 
happy user.

Up until now I've been using windows as my DAW platform, having a degree in 
sound engineering and being a teacher at a teachers training college. Having 
followed the progress of the music-apps pretty closely and finally found some 
time, I decided to see if I might get my feet wet with linux as a DAW. Since 
I'm familiar with mandrake and found THAC's 
rpms(http://rpm.nyvalls.se/sound9.1.html) I decided to go that route. I've 
been lurking on this forum for a couple of months now, and hope to get some 
help here in the process.

I got me a new harddisk for my DAW machine so that I wouldn't loose anything. 
Installed Mandrake 9.1 (just the basic stuff) Then I installed ardour, jack 
and the kernel-multimedia packages from THAC. I then tried to start jack with 
'jackstart -d alsa -d hw:0'
and got the following response:
"jackstart: cannot get realtime capabilities, current capabilities are:
           =ep cap_setpcap-ep
    probably running under a kernel with capabilities disabled,
    a suitable kernel would have printed something like "=eip"

I did a search on the google, and found out that someone had asked the same 
thing on this list, but the answer was: "look in the faq" - which I then did. 
And the faq say "recompile". I thought the idea of rpms was that I didn't 
have to recompile - but I'm probably wrong.  I just want to make sure before 
i jump onto something which I'd rather not do - because it scares me... (I'm 
a teacher and hobby sound engineer, not a linux wizard, but I'd like to 
learn) So do I have to recompile?


Another thing: I have the staudio dsp24 cport soundcard which was recognised 
and everything, but if anyone has a link or some tips on how to use this in 
the most effective way under linux I'd be very happy! In windows we have a 
virtual patchbay for attaching and rerouting the different ins and outs. How 
do I do this in linux?

I'd be very grateful for all help! Best regards 
Ketil Thorgersen

Hi all,

Does this card work ok with the latest alsa? I had a quick look at this 
: 
http://alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/doc-php/template.php3?company=Midiman&card=Delta+DiO+2496&chip=Envy24&module=ice1712
which sais something about the spdif on the front box not working, which 
confused me slightly because I didn't realise the card had a frontbox. I 
presume the spdif works ok on the card itself?

thanks, just being careful,
Jordan.

Hallo,


In your subject you ask about the "audiophile" card, which is not the
"DiO" card my Midiman. Both are different products. See for example:

I don't have the Dio but the Audiophile is supported quite well.

Hi Frank,

Oh, um, I ended up at that page via a link from the alsa sound card

same installation instructions. I've bought one now anway (an m-audio 
audiophile 2496) , so i'll soon find out...

Hallo,


Yes, the install instructions are all the same. It's a nice card, but
accessing the mixer through OSS-emulation doesn't work, so no volume
changing in xmms. :(

Please note that Mandrake 9.2 will be released in a few weeks, and contains  
the latest and greatest multimedia kernel, alsa, ardour/audacity, jack stuff  
including new gui, sweep, terminatorX, hydrogen, amsynth, ecasound, tkeca,  
snd, fluidsynth, rosegarden4, noteedit, muse, swami, etc. etc. etc.

Some of this stuff is on main CDs/ISOs, and some is installed automatically  
from online repositories using urpmi.  Urpmi is your friend.  I believe the  
Powerpack Edition will include almost all of the audio apps on CD or DVD  
though.

I will also update the Audio Workstation HowTo to be accurate as of 9.2 when  
it is released.

There's no need to switch distros if you're happy, but please be aware that  
we've been working very hard to try to keep multimedia support in Mandrake  
current and easy to install.

As I said, only out of the Powerpack box.  ;-)  But the rpms are available  
through urpmi as well.


Unfortunately, the multimedia kernel you must install yourself, becuase it is  
a security risk due to the capabilities patch.  Of cource you can do this with  
one command:
# urpmi kernel-multimedia
Which also worked with 9.1 by the way.


The howto for 9.1 is still available at
http://groundstate.ca/mdkaw.html
but it will be updated within the next few weeks to 9.2, mainly concerning the  
beautiful new GUI for jack, and ardour's new and improved configuration menus.

On the Ardour CVS site there is an extra file you must download

(Don't ask me why it isn't part of the CVS download, but that's the way

I thought the sfdb (sound file data base) was supposed to be a

Hallo,


Pd (and jMax) is way more than a synth system. You can do lots of
sequencing stuff in Pd as well. There are some gui elements missing
yet, like a decent pianoroll. If you need that, then jMax might be
worth looking at. But Pd can control itself. More so than I can... ;)

You'd have to run GNUStep to use it though. {Which is very cool anyway.}

Ha! Good Luck!

Seriously though, the two (IMO) most active Linux sequencer projects are Muse 
and Rosegarden, and they are at the moment both locked into MIDI. 

Probably, since you're already using pd, you might try to  make use of 
whatever the sequencer object in pd is (it's name escapes my at the moment - 
I think it's "xeq"). My apologies if you already know about this.

Another approach would be the Common Music / Common Music Notation / Common 
Lisp Music suite. CM is just begging for a nice portable front-end, and is 
most certainly open-ended about the type of music events it deals with.

Hope this helps!

Honestly, how could the reliability of ANY filesystem depend on whether you're  
using a laptop or not?  I hightly doubt if your file system knows whether it's  
in a desktop or a laptop in any way other than frequent power cycles.

I have used all three, and I agree that EXT3 is not ideal for multimedia.

Currently I use:
tmpfs for /tmp
xfs for any directories containing audio or video (usually /home)
reiserfs for all else (/usr, /var, etc.)

I have had a reiser partition get screwed up, but only once, and it was  
fixable.  I'm very impressed with xfs so far, but be aware that it's the  
latest version.

The /tmp setting makes much more of a difference than anything else though...

Hi,

I am trying to setup my new laptop to be a very friendly environment for
multimedia editing and software development.  I have been googling for
several hours now and am having trouble coming to a conclusive decision
over which filesystem to run.  I am leaning toward ReiserFS, but have
looked at XFS pretty closely.  I have read a little on
ext3, but what I have found seems a little bit dated now.  Any opinions
you guys might have would be very welcome.  Here is a summary of the
strengths/weeknesses of each of them as far as I can tell.

Summary:

XFS:  Great for a multimedia server.  Very fast performance with large
files.  Not as fast as ReiserFS with smaller files (E.g. software
development and day to day use).  Tendency to get corrupted on laptops.

ReiserFS:  Seems to be a good balance.  Pretty fast performance with large
files, excellent performance with smaller files, very fast at seeking out
the location of a file, robust in a laptop environment.

ext3:  slow.  Many tests online compared ext3 to XFS and Reiser and found
it failing regularly when used for large file read/writes.

Before I jump in and just do it...

Anyone have any horror stories of ReiserFS on a laptop, or ReiserFS with
Ardour?

Anyone have any anecdotes that illustrate that XFS is:
a.  Suitable for use on a laptop now?
        b.  Suitable for use on a developers box and not just on a
multimedia workhorse?

Thanks for *any* insight into these two filesystems.

-->><<--__-->><<--
Laptops go into suspend mode, come out of suspend mode, support suspend to
disk, etc.  Most of the bugs I have seen mentioned revolve around this
area.  Also, laptops tend to run out of power and just go thunk (if no
power management is configured) than desktops do.

I will probably do what you did.  Use reiserfs everywhere except where I
do my multimedia work.

How does ReiserFS perform for multimedia work?  OK, or do I really
absolutely need to use XFS?

Thanks,
--Craig

I strongly advice to upgrade to this version!

I think that Tkeca is becoming in a serious recording tool.

Changes:

- Tkeca don't use ewf files anymore, now each track has only one 
associated wave file. This is because sometimes ewf files generates sync 
problems
- Allows to start recording in the middle of a wave file            
- Punch-in and punch-out positions in the locate window (Thanks to Rocco 
for suggest this feature and helping me to test it)
- Automatic "Go to 00:00" after punching and after play/record for a 
time longer than the longest wave file
- Effect menu was improved, now you can see the name of the attached 
effect and it status.
- Added "Wave File Delete" command to Tools button
- Automatic filename extension when exporting to .ecs
- "Exported to..." message after exporting to ecs
- Enlarged pan and volume faders
- Enlarged "Options" window
- The way Tkeca generates the chainsetup was improved
- "Time Format" button was added. It allows to switch between MM:SS and 
SSSS. Useful for old Ecasound users who use to work with seconds
- "Wave Files" window no longer in this version
- The main window was simplified
- The general "Recording" checkbox was eliminated

You're right.  I rarely use battery power on my laptop, so I didn't think of  
that.
 

As I said previously, both reiser and xfs noticeably outperform etx3 for  
multimedia apps.  They seem about the same except for serious video editing,  
where xfs reigns supreme.  Like I said, for audio, the most important thing is  
to speed up /tmp... ext REALLY sucks for /tmp.

Yes, I remember someone (non-technical) telling me about this great system 
that allowed musicians on both coasts of North America to perform a "live" 
piece together, across the internet. It was some kind of university project. 
They even pulled out a newspaper or magazine article about it. I read it 
through several times. I could not believe that you can get latencies (esp. 
cross-continent) down low enough to allow "interactive jamming", where both 
sides hear each other in real time. 

Let's see (calculating on the back of an envelope): 3000 miles / 186000 
miles/second... that's nominally 16msec... that could be tolerable... but 
what about slowdown due to dielectric (speed of electric fields is less than 
speed in vacuum)? what about delays in electronic circuits? what about 
store/forward digital gear? At one point some traffic went via sattelite, 
which adds 2 x 22K miles (or about 1/4 second). Hmm, that's why the delay on 
some speech circuits (like when I phone my sister in the Dominican Republic) 
is very noticeable! Lately, I think ground fibre is cheaper (and faster) than 
satellite. For the moment, ignoring costs, I'm not even sure the network 
wizards are able to splice together a dedicated circuit coast-to-coast with 
audio hi-fi stereo bandwidth, even for "proof of concept". Even if they could 
(like a permanent phone call?), there would be little point, because in a 
digital (internet) network there would be real traffic, and hence variability 
(jitter), which can only be smoothed by buffering and delay. Stutter is 
usually worse than delay. So, I conclude that I'm mystified! Huh?

Now, if one is only concerned with one-way traffic, one can "cheat"! I 
concluded from the article (and thinking hard about it) that they must have 
used one site as a "reference site", piped their (partial) performance across 
the continent (with whatever additional delay/buffering), and then had the 
other orchestra "dub in" their part, and have that played at the 2nd site for 
their "live" audience. Or the audience might have been at a 3rd site, at this 
point it does not matter, just as long as it's not the 1st site! I seem to 
recall that the audience was seated in an auditorium on 2nd coast. So, yes 
they were "playing together" in some sense. And the audience was hearing the 
performance "live". However, I cannot believe that the orchestra at the 1st 
site was able to hear the 2nd site "live" at the same time they were playing? 

Has anyone else heard about this? Details? Thoughts?

p.s. I used to do some sound recording for 16mm newsreel film stuff, decades 
ago. Have you (with headphones on) ever tried to speak into a Nagra tape 
recorder with a true read head after the write tape monitoring head? You hear 
yourself about 1/2 second later. I had to take my headphones off, so I 
wouldn't hear a delayed "echo". I think that is also true for "real" (long 
delay) echo in recording? It can be paralyzing! Is that like stutterers?

p.p.s. I have recently been thinking a bit about psycho-acoustics, as I'm 
(re)learning some guitar playing. If you consider nerve transmission speeds, 
being able to play those real fast weedle-weedle-weedle guitar leads would 
seem impossible. What must be happening is that you are telling your fingers 
to move a fraction of a second before they actually move. Now add in the long 
echo delay, and I suspect that's too much to handle: 3 time bases: what you 
want to play, what you are playing (feel?), and what you hear. Comments?

Adding these values together, the peer would receive the audio and output=
 it=20
over the speaker after about 5.3 + 2 + 5 + 2 + 5.3 ms =3D 19.6 ms.
Now... the packing of the audio data isn't added. I have no idea how=20
much/little that would add. I imagine the data would be sent with some=20
compressed format and packed in frames, like mp3...
5 ms is a nice round number that might be applicable as the time to pack =
and=20
schedule new audio data to the network card, the same number might also b=
e=20
applicable for receiving and unpacking it at the jam-peer (tm).
This would mean that one way transportation would approximately take 30 m=
s.

Comparing this number to the actual time it takes for sound to travel thr=
ough=20
air, we find that in 30 ms sound has travelled some whooping 10.3 m.

So... the scenario might be comparable to if you and your mate (sorry,=20
jam-peer!) would be standing some 10 meters apart. Probably not ideal, bu=
t I=20
think it would be workable.

With midi pretty much all the packing/unpacking would be omitted leaving =

better possibilities of making it realizable.

But then again, who knows until one has tried :)
I wonder if ecasound/ogg/shoutcast would be a workable combination if one=

I have a UC33 which is one up from the UC16 and find it great. your unit 
will work with ALSA's usb-audio driver. I would advise preventing hotplug 
from loading it somehow, as the ALSA driver will work whenever the unit is 
turned on. Probably blacklisting the module would be best.


Will work with anything that uses ALSA MIDI support.

Yeah, it's called Soundmesh and your description is quite correct (including spelling). :-)

As far as the MIDI stuff is concerned, RTMix is capable of that by either relaying MIDI data to a client or a list of clients. Alternately, it can also convert MIDI to OSC, and/or to custom events and relay it that way.

Both apps can be found on my site (http://meowing.ccm.uc.edu/~ico/)

Patrick and anyone else who could help, please check this out.

I ran across a web page that always creates this problem I'm having. I'm
wondering if it's the setup of my machine, or possibly has something to
do with my specific HDSP 9652 driver, or is possibly showing up on all
of the HDSP product line.

I'd like to ask a few kind folks to visit this page in the next few days
and report back what happens on your system:

http://www.native-instruments.com

On the top right look for the sound demo of Absynth 2. There's both a
'play' button and a 'play all' button. Hit either one and listen to the
audio.

On my system before the audio plays I get a horrible, loud static noise,
and then the demo plays. On the 'play all' option I get this noise in
between each sample sound.

I'd like to get some feedback on what works for others on this site.
This may be a problem with only my driver, or maybe you'll hear it also
in which case it could be a more generic Alsa problem.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Cheers,
Mark

I would really recommend that people use tmpfs for /tmp (mounts /tmp in 
ram). I googled "tmpfs" and there were some very good articles out there.

I've been meaning to pose this question for a while, so maybe this is a 
good time to do it. Am I the only one out there that has their "Record 
Directory" mounted as a tmpfs? I went out and bought a half a gig of ram 
and brought my ram up to over 700 Megs of Ram. Now I just move all my 
audio files into the "Record Directory" (in other words, in Ram) and 
record out of that. Of course, I periodically copy the newly recorded 
file to the hard drive.

The only thing is... I can't vouch for this approach because I havn't 
had more than 2 (sterio 48000) wavs playing and 1 sterio 48000 wav being 
recorded to at the same time. But there hasn't been so much as one 
hiccup. But I guess the reason I haven't mentioned about this approach 
is because I've (many times before) thought I stumbled on to something 
great, only to find out that it wasn't as good as it looked on the 
outside. But I have the feeling I'm going to keep getting good 
performance from this meathod. And with the price of Ram these days, 
it's an affordable approach.

Yeah, if you got the ram this should be pretty good.

I'm wondering about the size of the partition though.
I've heard that tmpfs is dynamically resized. With this kind of approach, 
wouldn't it be a good idea if it was possible to set the partition to a 
specific size? This to avoid putting to much in the partition and causing the 
machine to start swapping.
Or is it already possible to specify a size for tmpfs partitions?

/Robert






-->><<--__-->><<--


Yes, the "size" mount option.  In my /etc/fstab I have the line

tmpfs   /tmp   tmpfs   defaults,size=800M   0   0

This gives me a /tmp of 800M, on a machine with 288M RAM and 1.2GB of 
swap.  Otherwise a tmpfs filesystem is limited to half of RAM.  Yes, 
this means that if I put too much in /tmp the machine will start to 
swap, but that's OK with me because the swap disk is different than the 
disk I record to.

Yeah, there was some work done about it in MIT. Many universities have
this thing called the Access Grid, which is a sort of high bandwidth video
coferencing rig - it uses stereo 16bit uncompressed audio at pretty low
latency (I'd guess < 20ms).

Hi, We worked here with differents apps to do that, one we really used 
for that is called RAT : 
http://www-mice.cs.ucl.ac.uk/multimedia/software/rat/
It lets you have a conferencies room, where friends could join you and 
each of you could send sound to the others and jam together with very 
low latency!!!
The others tools are speakfreely, sfspeaker, but it's more like peer to 
peer built. Or you have the solution to build patch with PureData, mix 
sound streaming from the other, and change parameters with netsend and 
netreceive (TCP control protocol), the object in PD to have live audio 
streaming are oggcast~ or mp3cast~

the simple idea for that is :

source -> mp3cast~ -> Icecast server -> "internet"->mp3amp~ (in PD - 
which could received a stream in a patch) -> patch (and reverse the 
process!!!)

PureData -> http://testpd.iem.at/about/

hope it will help

Hmm, (realtime) games generally extrapolate (predict) the game-object states based on their last known position/input... if  they'd wait for clients to sync first the game would get pretty jerky.

I don't think it is possible to apply these methods to MIDI, much less to audio. Game players live with a certain ammount of inacuracy, but while it may be a little frustrating to not have hit the other player because he wasn't really where your client thought he was, the audio equivalent to that might be outright annoying :-)

that's interesting..
I don't know about the nerve transmisison speeds but it's the learning process 
and repetition that allows some people play that fast.  Also, some people 
seem to be physically more apt to it than others (not all guitarists can play 
as fast as, say Al Di Meola or John McLaughlin, even if they're fast).


Well, in practice, depending how good you are, you know at least 1 measure in 
advance what you're going to play.  The rest is just automatic repetition of 
what you have learned in the long hours of practice.  Obviously it is alittle 
different when you improvise but, depending on the type of music, a lot of 
improvisers practice their 'chops' anyways.  I used to joke about some 
players that they play faster than they think but this is not far from truth, 
I think.


Yeah, confusing :)
I remember when I first tried some MIDI guitar+synth, years ago, and more 
complex patches had about 1/4 to 1/2 sec lag.  It was annoying. And that was 
only on 2 time bases: playing/feeling and hearing the result.

Steve and Christian,
   Thanks for the feedback. Possibly this is an HDSP type bug, either in the
complete family, or in just the HDSP 9652. In the cold light of the morning
I wonder now why I didn't reboot my newly constituted Reaktor Session
machine back into Planet CCRMA Redhat and try it there, so I'll do that this
evening. That machine uses a Hammerfall Light.

   I hope one or two HDSP type users (Patrick? Jesse?) Might run by this web
site and listen to Absynth 2. It's not a bad way to spend a couple of
minutes anyway.

   It would actually be a positive outcome (I think) to find it is only the
HDSP 9652 since then I could focus on just working to get that fixed.

   Thanks very much for your help.

Hi,

dealing with linux GUI audio applications
I have found that the following 
feature would be usefull:

I want to stick or glue some windows of
*different* applications together so that
they be organized in "solid body"
i.e. so that I could minimize/restore,
move them together. 

(you can find an example of similar behavior
 in how xmms organizes its subwindows)

I know that some window managers offer
"border gravity" and some others offer
virtual desktops, 
but sometimes it's just not enough.

As fas as I can tell the linux audio 
goes the unix way in the sence that there are
many small interacting programs each doing 
its own thing. So one needs to have *many*
small GUI apps open at the same time.
And the feature Im talking about would
be realy usefull.

So my question is:
Which window manager support such "sticky"
feature?

horsh




-->><<--__-->><<--


Try out fluxbox as a windowing environment. You can tab windows together
into groups. You switch between apps by selecting the tab. The overall group
can be resized, moved and minimized with one action.

Cheers,
Mark





-->><<--__-->><<--

Enlightenment is capable of doing all of this.  It calls them Groups.
You can create groups of windows and define exactly what operations
affect all members of a group (for example: you could have moving,
resizing, and iconification affect all windows in a group, but killing
only affect the actual window you clicked).

Check it out - sounds exactly like what you want.

I've run into this problem myself, not only with different apps 
but with single apps like gimp and gambas that throw 80 little 
windows up on the screen.  My workaround has been to use 
workspaces (which I normally don't care for) and put all the 
windows of the offending app(s) on a separate workspace from the 
other things I'm doing.  Not as cool as an MDI-type container 
that holds all the windows, but it is effective.

 From a few days I'm trying to use my pc as a synth to improve the 
sounds of my keyboard.
I've installed low-latency kernel, alsa, jack, muse, rosergarden... etc 
from planet ccrma.

I can't start jack with the period (-p) under 512 frames (with my SB 
Audigy) and a number of periods (-n) under 2. That mean that I have a 
latency of at least 23.2 msec (from qjackctl).

Does this latency affects the sound I hear when I play my MIDI keyboard 
with a synth (for example muse)?
Does anyone knows if the Audigy (player) can go under 512 of the -p 
parametre in jack?

With windows & cubase VST I can get a latency of about 10 ms that it's 
good for my purpose, while 20 msec

Can I play directly in to alsa to reduce the latency (jump the jack 
latency)?

I think that the only way to get the so claimed 2.9 msec latency is to 
reduce to 64 the numbers of frames, but I don't know if is it possible 
with my sound card and if my actual limit of 512 is due misconfiguration 
or is the real limit for the Audigy.

Anyone want correct, suggest, help me is welcome.

Antonio, bye

Hi Antonio,

Tuesday 30 September 2003 19.53 skrev Antonio:

Yes, the output buffers which are 2x512 frames need to be filled before you 
hear anything.


No, emu10k1/2 based cards are currently limited to this setting. I think this 
is a limitation of the driver and not the hardware though.

There is an asio driver available for windows from some russian developers 
that achieve massively lower latency. (I think 2x128, or even lower)
Someone should really check with them if there is something easy that can be 
changed in the alsa driver to achieve this...


You can skip jack if you want, but there is no difference in latency.


Some people argue it's a problem with the hardware of Audigy/SBLive, but I'm 
quite confident that it's a driver problem.
Or, put another way, the problem is probably that Creative doesn't provide 
good enough specs of the card.

/Robert




-->><<--__-->><<--

Cool!


this *may* be a limitation of the Audigy. I have one, but it's in a windows
box so I cannot check for you. I remember it was pretty high though compared
to my RME cards.


Yep. MIDI in latency + soft synth latency + Jack output latency


With soft synths that support it. Timidity I think supports this. Maybe AMS,
but I'm not sure. Some of the older ones like Bristol, etc., before Jack
came along.


I do not remember being able to run this card that low. I can do this with
my RME cards.


Not a lot of info. All I have to give. Sorry.

Good luck,
Mark







-->><<--__-->><<--

The problem is mostly the audigy but also that jack is not designed for 
badly designed hardware like usb audio devices. There are some 
workarounds to allow for better latency which are in process at the 
moment. Currently they are in the TODO list and not being worked on IIUC.

If we are lucky Jack O'Quin will whip it out in the near future but 
don't hold your breath. (JACK developers are notoriously picky about 
what they spend there time on and workarounds for poorly designed 
hardware are not on the top of the list)

USB devices require a period size > 2 and provide fixed sized packets 
which basically fly in the face of good audio design. It seems that the 
audio companies are lying when they promote usb devices as being able to 
accomplish professional low latency. Probably 2.9msec is never going to 
be possible with usb hardware.

You may be able to get better results with alsa native but then you will 
not be able to take advantage of jacks routing possibilities.

With current JACK I cannot get good results from my usb quattro unless I 
use a period size of 1024 and can only use two i/os. It's pretty 
frustrating :/

Actually its fixed /time/ packets that cause the prolem. Some bright spark
decided that all USB audio blocks should be (multiples of?) 1ms long
regardless of the sample rate. That means that at 44.1kHz the packets are
variable, non power-of-two sizes. Yuk.

Let me first say I'm not terribly used to compiling Linux apps. I
usually intall Debian packages with apt-get. So I'm probably making a
very simple error, but I'm asking here because someone else might well
have built Audacity from source.

So here's the problem:
Whe I try compile Audacity 1.2 beta, 
I get screefuls of messages like this:

libaudacity.a(PCMAliasBlockFile.o): In function
`PCMAliasBlockFile::BuildFromXML(wxString, char const **)':

`wxFileName::Assign(wxFileName const &)'
/usr/include/wx/filename.h:100: undefined reference to
`wxArrayString::~wxArrayString(void)'

The system is Debian, mostly stable but I've installed quite a few bits
and pieces from testing. In response to earlier problems with
config and compilation I installed:
libwxbase2.4-dev
wxwin2.4-headers
libwxgtk2.4
zlib1g-dev
libwxgtk2.4-dev

But I can't see what's missing now and I don't understand enough about the
error messages, not being intimately falmiliare with libwx (it must have
something to do with that)

Any ideas, please?

Hello again - this may be a better question for the ardour list, but I can't 
get subscribed to that, so...

two questions:
1) 
Does anybody know - does Ardour support assigning tracks to outputs other than 
just 1 and 2 - is this an Alsa issue?

To explain, my goal is to have 24 tracks of audio on Ardour, and not mix in 
ardour, to split the tracks - track 1 goes out on output 1, track 2 on output 
2, 3 on output 3, etc. (and the same with the inputs, if possible), so that I 
can mix on my behringer ddx3216 32 channel digital mixer  - this is one major 
reason why I have an HDSP 9652, because it has 24 channels of ADAT litepipe 
i/o, which I'm taking into the board...

but I don't know if Alsa supports this, and I don't know if Ardour supports 
this.  All I know is I'm configuring the system, and I just got the HDSP to 
make sound for the first time, and when I open up ardour to see how things 
are, I expect to be able to go to the routing screen off the track, and see 
alsa have 24 outputs, but still I only see two...I don't know if I'm not yet 
properly configured, or if my goal isn't even supported...


2)
when I start Jack (right now anyway), I've been using:
jackd -R -d alsa -p 2048

and it starts just fine, and gives me this message:

You appear to be using the ALSA software "plug" layer, probably
a result of using the "default" ALSA device. This is less
efficient than it could be. Consider using a ~/.asoundrc file
to define a hardware audio device rather than using the plug layer

I have a feeling this has something to do with question 1 - am I right?  what 
does it have to do with it?


Thanks in advance for any info! :)


ps:
for those that were following my HDSP 9652 thread:  yep, I got sound.  I 
downgraded the firmware and have applied Thomas's patch.  What's weird, 
though, is that somewhere along the way, I don't remember when, I got the new 
kernel from Planet.  apparently I kept the old one (the one that ends in 
acpi), and was booting with that, and wasn't getting sound, and hadn't yet 
really got a clean rebuild of the alsa drivers.  I was working on that, and 
had emailed the planet list with some questions about that.  then, I rebooted 
and started what I THINK is the new kernel (it ends in .rh90 on my boot 
loader) - it didn't want to deal with the ethernet card, so I couldn't get 
online *laugh* - but I was deleting a command in terminal and all of a sudden 
for the first time heard a "bloop".  so I played back some stuff using 
audacity, hydrogen and ardour, and sure enough, sound.  understandably, 
things were just coming out every channel, and audacity played back some low 
res (22khz) sounds all fuzzy (which is expected, since I don't think the HDSP 
likes low res audio like that), but there was sound.  I guess the patch and 
new alsa drivers were talking with the new kernel but not the old.  now I 
figure I need to just clean out all the kernels (except the original redhat 
one, you know, so I can run), and rebuild all of it.  problem is, I'm afraid 
of doing that with the new kernel, for fear that the ethernet problem isn't 
connected to my dirty messy screwed up builds, and just has to do with the 
new kernel...

Ok guys, I am a moron.  I wasn't adding -d hw:0 to the jackd command, and that 
matters :)

when I do:
jackd -R -d alsa -d hw:0 -p 2048

I see all kinds of outputs in ardour *laugh*

well, uh - uhm *blush* - BYE!  *RUNS AWAY FAST!!*

You can output any track to any available outputs.  If your
soundcard has 24 outputs when properly configured ("properly"
being the operative word in that statement), then your
goal is achievable.  Walk with me:

1) In ardour, click on "Session->Add Audio Track(s)->mono".

2) Click on "Windows->Mixer".

3) A window will popup with your track in it.  Click
the "Output" button at the very bottom and select "Edit".

4) By defualt, the track will be outputting to "alsa_pcm:playback_1".
To add an output, click on the "out 1" heading for the list box and
select an output from the "alsa_pcm" tab under "available connections".
To remove an output, click on it.

The procedure for changing recording inputs is similar, just click
on the "Input" button in the mixer view instead of "Output".


you should try:

jackd -R -d alsa -d hw:0 -r rate -p period

Where 'rate' and 'period' are your soundcards
native rates.

{SNIP}
{SNIP}
{tho' FVWM is fairly similar and makes for a really nice


Unfortunatly, I've only worked with FVWM so I can't compare it to the 
rest. But I can tell You that it's __very__ lightweight, boots up 
__very__ quickly and uses __very__ little resources. And there's not 
even __one__ "built in" feature that You're "stuck with". For 
instance... in KDE (the only other Window Manager I have experience 
with) always loads the "task bar". I'm sure if I hacked around I could 
find a way to __not__ start up with it. But FVWM can be so stripped down 
that there's not even a back ground color. All you see is that grey mesh 
that You see just before (whatever window manager You're using at the 
time) starts up. Yet it has ways of creating just about any convience 
you want (like a task bar).

Also... (and maybe this was what you were referring to when you said 
"border gravity") but the config file let's you set (if my memory serves 
Me well) "--geometry" for a window, so that it will open up at whatever 
position you want (or whatever desktop you want to send it to).

And if You're completly determined to have them all together, locked 
into the (aformentioned) "FvwmPartion" (which sounds like a great 
approach), but yet, the whole modual filled with programs are too big 
for Your screen, FVWM has a feature were the Virtual Desktops can be 
"borderless". So if the bottom half of the modual disapeared beyond the 
bottom of Your screen, you can move your mouse down to the bottom and 
all of a sudden, you're at the Desktop were the lower half of the modual 
disappeared to (you would look up at the top of the screen and see the 
second half of the modual). Of course, in that case, maybe it would be 
better to have just have the most used parts of the components sent to 
desktop 1 (on start-up) and the secondary components sent to desktop 2, 
each stuck together with it's own FvwmPartion modual.

The other thing that is cool (and I assume is common to all Window 
Managers) is the ability to have __some__ programs show up on __all__ 
desktops, and __others__ show up on __only__ __one__ desktop. Which can 
be another way of organizing things. I can see this as an advantage if 
(for instance) you have so many programs opened up that you are 
__forced__ to use mulitple desktops, then at least you can use the 
"common to all" program (a mixer would be a good example) follow you to 
each desktop you go to. So... there's your mixer up on the left top 
corner of you screen... yet you just moved to a different desktop were 
there's suddenly a whole new set of programs... and yet... the mixer is 
still were you like it to be.

Of course... You can alway learn C, take the source code of all these 
programs and create one "monster program" (OK, that was kind of a long 
shot... but I thought I would suggest it... heehee...).

Okay, I'm trying to be a little more fastidious about finding what's wrong.  My HDSP/MF soundcard freezes with several applications, including play, mpg321, and when I play a soundfile in audacity.  It always happens at the end of the soundfile, or if I command-C or push the stop button (in audacity) while the soundfile is playing.  It says there's a segmentation fault, and then I can't get my card to respond to any app at all (they all say the device is busy or nonexistent).  ps aux doesn't show anything at all.  When I try /sbin/service alsasound restart, I get this:
/sbin/service alsasound restart

Shutting down sound driversnd-pcm-oss: Device or resource busy
snd-mixer-oss: Device or resource busy
snd-hdsp: Device or resource busy

ALSA driver already running
Sound driver snd-hdsp is already loaded


So that doesn't do anything at all.  I have none of these problems with my other soundcard (an onboard nvidia chip).  Really the only way I've figured how to fix it is to reboot.  Is there a way to debug these things and find out how to fix the segmentation fault?  Does anyone know what about the HDSP/MF (or its driver) would be helping to cause it?  Is there a way to force ALSA to restart?

Thanks,

Thanks to all for the anwers.

Anyway (there have been some incomprention) my card is a pci audigy 
player, not an usb one.

I use for example ams in realtime driven via midi. If I don't use jack 
and output directly to alsa, why doesn't the latency decrease?
I think:
   midi in latency + synth lat + alsa out lat
instead of
   midi in latency + synth lat + jack lat + alsa out lat

What's wrong?


I've another issue. When I use the digital output of my card I cannot 
adjust the volume, but only mute/unmute the output from the alsamixer.

Is it a driver limit or maybe have I to put something in asound.conf (I 
don't have that file, only asound.state)?

Antonio, bye.

Hi folks,

I've been trying for months now to get arecord to work with the built-in 
microphone and/or mic jack of my laptop but it just won't work.  Since 
the alsa developers seem totally uninterested in fixing or even 
understanding this problem (yes, I've posted on alsa-devel many many 
times) and the built-in A/D on the laptop is unlikely to be any good 
anyhow I've decided to investigate an external A/D system.  It's for a 
laptop so it would have to be either PC card, USB, or firewire, not 
PCI.  Compatability and reliability are a big deal to me -- I'm fed up 
with sending mail to alsa-devel, which seems to route to /dev/null as 
far as I can tell.  Can anybody recommend a solution that's really 
simple to set up and reliable to use under linux and doesn't cost an 
arm and a leg (e.g. less than $400)?  I'm not too picky about number of 
ins and outs or fancy features, more picky about quality, 
compatability, ease-of-use, and reliability.

Thanks,
-n8

Look into /var/log/meessages, you will probably find an "Ooops" there
(that's a crash inside the kernel, it can bring the whole machine down
or - looks like your case - it affects only a driver or sets of
drivers). Once you get into that state only a reboot can cure it. 

If you find an Oops you should feed all the relevant lines into
"ksymoops" and post the result to alsa-devel...

There has been no word from Thomas on this, so I think the answer is 'no'.

thomas has been moving out of his place in France and living with a couple
of other people (I think) until he moves elsewhere in Europe later this
year. (Unless he's started moving already!) ;-)For this reason he has been
somewhat absent from our company.

At the same time, he has a big patch that also includes fixes for the HDSP
9632 card that he was going to put in at the same time, along with a rewrite
of hdspmixer, etc.

I know he said 'last last week', but this one has taken awhile, and may take
longer.

(I have two other 'problems' I'd like him to look at, but I will not even
consider telling him what they are until this is in CVS!!!)

Hi,

onsdagen den 1 oktober 2003 16.06 skrev Antonio:

As Fernando pointed out jack doesn't add any latency, it's the same audio 
buffers that are filled every iteration.

Jack does add somewhat to the CPU utilization, but the price for that is very 
low when compared to the connectivity possibilities you aquire.

To lower the latency you need to adress the buffering on the soundcard. 
Some softsynths may have their own internal buffers that may add to the 
latency. Normally this isn't a problem though.

As for the scenario you laid out eariler.
Using softsynths at 2x512, I do exactly that and I think it's quite usable. My 
system can usually go lower than that, latency wise, but I don't feel a need 
to put the extra load on the system.


I have both an Audigy and an SB-Live, to my knowledge I can't make any of them 
use buffers smaller than 512 frames.
But as I said earlier, I'm convinced it's a driver issue and may be fixable.

I think the biggest problem is that it is a (randomly?) _variable_ delay line. 
Some early voice-over-internet work was done more than 20 years ago, and it 
was deemed "not ready for prime time" mostly because of lack of "guarantee of 
service/quality" (i.e. variable latency, and occasional dropout). The 
underlying technology has not changed (that) much (if at all?). TCP/IP was 
defined in RFCs when? 20 or 30 years ago? Some refinements, granted.


That would be interesting. In general, viz. computers, I believe in the "*nix 
credo" which goes something like "many ways to skin a cat". Choose your 
favorite, or the one that best fits the situation. The more tools the better.

Hmm. How are you measuring latency? I'm not sure how to do it (sufficiently 
accurately). I'm running SuSE 8.2, which some have suggested includes the 
low-latency patch, but I don't think so. I've been too busy (lazy?) to check 
or implement. I find even when playing some .ogg file to jam along with, that 
hiccups are "disturbing" or distracting. Maybe I've got problems (as a 
musician wannabe) with my timing? I've got my .ogg files on a server, but I 
believe xmms pre-buffers (I recall setting it to 1/2 second at one point?) 
its compressed audio stream, so I think I'm only hearing jitter from variable 
interrupt response (and temporarily blocked interrupts?)?

Your other comment (in another post) about "real life lost packets" (UDP 
comparison) is interesting. You would have to transmit a time code in each 
packet, so the player can continually "re-sync" the audio. I don't think the 
current audio streams do that? I think they "assume" (Benny Hill?) that the 
audio stream is continuous, and therefore you can derive the timing?

Yes, but given some parameters of your intended network you *should*
be able to pick a fixed latency that will be big enough almost all
of the time.  Obviously, this isn't foolproof, and it probably
doesn't scale, but given a controlled network it might just work
well enough for some applications.  When it doesn't, well... try
something else.

For instance, routing audio from a recording/mix machine in your studio to another 
in a different room over a 100/1000 Mb ethernet link for the purposes of mastering.
The network is controlled, fast, *and* the latency doesn't particularly
matter in this context.

Now try to do this over the internet generically, and you'll have to settle for
both massively increased latency and reduced channel count, and
you'd probably need to venture into lossy compression too (as an option)
if that satisfies your needs.

Anyway, it will be a fun experiment.

Hello again - I hope this is the right list for this topic (so far I can only 
get subscribed to two and I keep bouncing back and forth between them...)

first off, may I say thank you to the list members for bearing me, and extra 
thank you still to those who take the time to respond - amazing gentlemen and 
ladies you all are; I realize I have written what amounts to several novels 
worth of emails in the past couple weeks! :)

well I started a couple threads earlier about strangeness (or what I think was 
strangeness) with compiling and installing hdspmixer and such...the questions 
I had I didn't figure out, but somehow hdspmixer was able to run - whether 
it's ACTUALLY working, I don't know for sure sure...

THAT having been said,
I only know of a couple people who are using the HDSP 9652, along with a 
couple who've developed for it - Mark K, Thomas, Kevin, et al - does any of 
this sound familiar? :

--
a) I've been doing a lot of back and forth and reading but I'm a bit confused 
as to what hdspmixer is DOING (which makes it harder to tell if it's working 
:) )

b) my goal, as I may have said on other threads, is to be running ardour with 
my HDSP 9652, sending each of 24 individual adat optical channels out to 1 
channel input in my behringer ddx3216 (outfitted with adat i/o).  An earlier 
thread I started was solved by me adding -d hw:0 to my jackd command line 
(duh), where I wasn't seeing 24 (actually 26) possible outputs when I clicked 
on "output" in the mixer in ardour

now I'm able to see the outputs, and assign them as they should be, meanwhile 
in hdspmixer i've picked the preset which assigns ins, out and "playback" 
(what would be the difference between "out" and "playback" I wonder) to adat 
outputs, etc:

--
first I used hdspconf to change the HDSP to 44.1 for purposes of these tests
next I ran hdspmixer

I kept hdspmixer running, then started jack from a terminal using:
su
jackd -R -d alsa -d hw:0 -r 44100 -p 2048

then started ardour from a terminal:
su
ardour -n  <--- that's so no splash screen will appear

but what was showing up at the board wasn't what I was expecting *laugh*  if I 
routed a track to channel 1, then it showd up a 3 db too quiet at channel 1 
on the mixer, and at the right volume on channel 2 (I was using a -12 1khz 
test tone that I generated with the board and was able to record to ardour - 
ardour indeed is playing it at -12.1 - I think the point 1 is explanable but 
I'll skip that 'cause it doesn't matter just now)   if I routed the track to 
channel 2, it didn't show up anywhere.  odd numbered tracks after that seemed 
to be showing up on 1-2 just like 1 did (although I can't confirm the 
consistancy of this)

I experimented with opening up qjackconnect, which was the only one of the 
many patch bay programs from planet that showed 24 capture and playback 
channels and connecting captures to playbacks.  this didn't seem to do 
anything, which made me wonder just what qjackconnect was for.

then I closed all, closed the hdspmixer program, and started just jack and 
ardour.  the results from that are:

routed to channel 1, it shows up at channel 1, 3 db quiet, channels 3, 7, 9, 
11, 17, 19 and 23  at 30 db quiet and channels 5, 13 and 21 at 12 dbs quiet - 
wha?

routed to channel 2, it shows up only at channel 2! 3 dbs under - actually, 
this 3 dbs may be a non-problem issue in the board, so possibly it can be 
ignored

routed to channel 3, it shows up on 1, 2, 3 and 4 and some other channels at 
half volume - wha wha?

channel 4, nothing

channel 5 --> 4, 5, 6 and others

ok you get the picture.  randomness.  a weird mess.


I don't know if this is a driver problem, a HDSP 9652/alsa driver patch 
problem, an hdspmixer problem (I did, as I mentioned, have oddities on 
compiling that program), a jack issue, an alsa issue, a bug in ardour, a bug 
in alsa drivers, etc. etc. etc.

I only know of a couple people who are using the HDSP 9652 - Mark K, does any 
of this sound familiar?

clearly there are thousands of details - anyone who wants to talk about this 
and wants other info, as usual, ask and ye shall receive :)  (although in 
some cases, a request for details may yield first the question "how do I find 
that?" :) )

thanks and I hope this is interesting and stimulating, maybe even 
educational!!! :)

xmms's buffer shouldn't be a problem, it's just for monitoring. It's the =
apps (softsynth) that you play that should be responsive.
If you don't use softsynth and you use xmms just for monitoring, hiccups =
through your network should lead to a network analysis. Maybe there are o=

Anyway, if you want to play with audio apps like soundtrackers, softsynth=
, etc.  I warmly recommend you to enable/install a low-latency + preempt =
patched kernel. The latency is dramatically reduced ( _largely_ under 40 =
ms ) and best of all, everything is more responsive ( Xfree! ).

It can be a real pain to put up. I am pleased to have done it with my man=

So there is! RFC 1889 defines it...


It seems that RTP is normally used encapulated in UDP, so as long as
your router is happy with the UDP port numbers you use for RTP you
should be OK.

Hi all,
   Small update. In my case the 'weird glitchy noise' appears to be the
HDSP 9652 changing sample frequencies. My system is set up with the 9652
as the Master clock device and a frequency of 44.1K. It's ADAT1 output
and input go to an external A/D/D/A that runs at 48K unless it receives
a different sync frequency. Normally everything syncs up and runs at
44.1K in this configuration.

   The first thing I found that seems like a bug is that when I change
the sample frequency of the card using hdspconf from 44K to 48K I get
the same ugly noise. It seems to me that something should be done in the
driver so that when clock frequency is change the driver would ensure
that these noises do not happen. 

   The second thing I noted was that when I browse these web pages that
cause the noise problems, the ADAT1 input sync/lock indicator in
hdspconf changes from sync to lock and back to sync. I'm guessing that
something is changing the card's frequency from 44K to 48K. (Flash
possibly? Or something weird in the driver?)

   The third thing I noted, which seems pretty weird, is that if I set
the card up to be master but run at 48K, then when I browse these web
pages the noise happens and something changes the card's base rate back
to 44.1K permanently. That seems quite wrong. I really don't want
anything messing with my frequency settings on a permanent basis, but
something is.

   I'm hoping that someone else running a card in the HDSP line can pull
up hdspconf and see if any of this happens with your system. Possibly
you won't see it unless you have a similar, external bi-direction
A/D/D/A that wants to run at 48K, but maybe you'll spot somethign
happening on the sync indicator that's similar to what I'm seeing.

Thanks,
Mark




-->><<--__-->><<--
<SNIP>

hdspmixer is taking each and every one of the 52 inputs (26 ADAT
channels and 26 software channels) and it is 'mixing' them to each and
every one of the 26 output channels. It is capable of setting an routing
volume for each path separately. (Which could have something to do with
your -3db thing)

Whether a specific input is routed to a specific output is made visible
when you click on the black square below a name like In 1 where it
probably says A1 1+2 on your setup if you're running default conditions.
You'll get a list of outputs. Any output with a check mark has some
amount of this inputs signal routed to that output.



I think I maybe did see something like this with older versions of
hdspmixer.


OK, so now I need to ask what you mean by 'channels'. There are three
'channel 1's ' in hdspmixer - In 1, Out 1 and A1 1. Are you seeing this
audio on Out 1 when Ardour plays audio? Do you see Out 1 audio making it
to A1 1? 


This sounds like you're possibly not running hdspmixer 1.3. In an xterm
type 'which hdspmixer'. IF you get /usr/bin/hdspmixer, I think you have
the wrong one. IF you get usr/local/bin/hdspmixer then you are probably
OK.

In any case, unless you did something special when you did the
./configure step I think the new one (at least on my system is in
/usr/local/bin, so make sure you are running that.

Provide an lspci output so we can see that you've got the right
firmware.

Provide the output of 'cat /proc/asound/card0/hdsp '. If you see 2
status and two control registers then you have at least partially the
new driver. (I think) If you don't, then something is definitely a bit
off.

<SNIP>

It does actually. I mostly think that if you are doing things right with
the tools them you are still running the wrong software somewhere.
Probably your hdsp.o file isn't the right one is my guess, but we'll
just have to find out.

Good luck,
Mark

Dont know if this was mentioned before in the thread so here goes.

To compile on RH 9 where i had wxGTK 2.4  i simply opened the makefile
and modified one line.
instead of checking for wxwindows  i wrote  wxGTK as follows : 

line  3834 and abouts  

# Extract the first word of "wx-config", so it can be a program name with args.
set dummy wxgtk-2.4-config; ac_word=$2
echo "$as_me:3835: checking for $ac_word" >&5

Once it got past that part of the config it just rolled along and compiled
without significant errors.

Sorry if this was said earlier, i ditched a bunch of emails without looking :|

uh - I'm pretty sure I wasn't getting that glitching noise when I was
changing frequencies - although the first time I ran hdspconf, I changed the
spdif button to professional, or something - I changed all around in that
part of the window, and at some point, the last 8 channels on my board
showed up with pegged meters - no audible noise, just pegged meters.  I had
to reboot everything to get them to go away and be able to hear sound again

the glitchy noise you describe actually sounds like it's to be expected when
changing freqs - it's not something I would worry about in my studio - after
all, it's not something people do, say, in the middle of a song *laugh* -
although the part about websites changing it, that's a little screwy






-->><<--__-->><<--

hmmm - this makes me think to go check if things aren't routed to multiple
places



ahh - to clarify (if I can!) - when I'm referring to channel/track 1 on
ardour, that's in ardour, of course, and then when I say it shows up at
channel 1 on the board, that's on my digital mixer - not on hdspmixer -
during the tests where hdspmixer was running, I wasn't looking at it, partly
because I'm a dolt, partly because it didn't matter to me for some reason,
and partly because I believe in my make, the part that was broken was
metering, so I'm not sure I would've been able to see the signal (this is
something that I just remembered upon waking up this morning)

of course, I also did a bunch of testing with hdspmixer not running



huh.  duh. I didn't think of that.  I assumed I had no copy of hdspmixer
before I downloaded your 1.3 tarball.  perhaps 1.3 never did install, and I
had 1.1, and that's what I'm running.  thanks :)  (remember I had unclean
making going on when I was compiling and installing)


firmware rev 65 - I'll go get an lspci later to confirm


*nod*



*nod*  ok this is good info - thanks :)  I'll be back atcha with a report in
a while...





-->><<--__-->><<--
a ps to this - I may need to clean out all versions of hdspmixer and start
over with 1.3 - can somebody give me a low down on how to make sure I've got
everything cleaned out?  rpm makes this so easy that I have yet to be
confident when I'm not using rpm...

This is just to let those who are interested know that I just commited 
some fixes which greatly improve the sound quality in jackEQ and allow 
the crossfaders to be fully functional including mute and all fader options.

Apart from being able to internally assign jack i/os I feel this version 
qualifies for professional mixing use. To prove that I am going to be 
using it live everyday for the next week while being paid to do so :)

Still only available from cvs you may need to wait a day or two to get 
the newest version depending on the sf lag at the moment.

http://jackeq.sf.net

TODO:

internally assigning jack i/os
multiple interfaces 	- Long interface
			- Tall interface (current)
extra button functionality - mostly for ease of use
unlimited channel support (mostly a gui design issue)
variety of xfader gain slopes for better mixing.
MIDI fader console support.

No, I think that wording was right, but maybe we need to do a bit of a reset
to better understand exactly where you are at this point, what's working,
what's not, and then figure out what to do.

(In the above example, since the hardware input group is 0-25, and the
software group (output from Ardour, input to HDSP 9652) is 26-51, I think
you are routing the second playback channel to the first ADAT output
channel. It works, but I'm not sure you meant to do that.

In other threads (not this one) I've mentioned that I made headway faster
with this card by focusing on input signals before output signals. On the
HDSP 9652 the 26 inputs you see in hdspmixer in the top line are the inputs.
Are those working correctly? Can you send data input each of those from your
mixer and see meters operating correctly on all 26 inputs? (Or only 24 if
you don't have some spdif equipment.)

I made a mistake wasting weeks trying to get sound out when it was never
going to work. When I shifted to inputs Thomas and I worked out most of the
bugs pretty quickly.

OK, so assuming you check the inputs, and that they all work, then can you
route hardware input audio using hdspmixer to a hardware output? If all 26
inputs do NOT work, then you still have a driver or hdspmixer issue we need
to solve.

Assuming you get an input signal routed to an output, then you should be
able to drive whatever ADAT device you have that will create sound and hear
what's going on.

Only AFTER all of that works would I bother with Ardour at all. When the
stuff above works perfectly, then it will take you very little time to get
Ardour working. If the above stuff doesn't work, Ardour doesn't have a
chance.

- Mark





-->><<--__-->><<--

OK then do NOT run ANY version of hdspmixer as the older versions will do
weird routing and mess up all your tests. You probably need to do a cold
boot or something to make sure you have everything back to default.

You need to do everything with amixer commands until you get version 1.3
compiled correctly.

I'll just say this again for clarity. Do not run ANY version of hdspmixer
OTHER THAN version 1.3 or the results are weird and the whole card acts
crazy. (Audio data gets written to control registers using version 1.2. ;-)
Crazy results! ;-)

Let's get a software person to help you solve the hdspmixer problem.

Fernando supplies alsa-tools, which is where I think you got your 1.2
version, or whatever you are running. Maybe you can figure out from that how
to get this built. On Gentoo it builds fine for me. I haven't tried it on
Redhat.

inputs.
your

hmmm.  yeah.  that would be a different tact than I've been taking.

I'm trying to figure what I would do to test this.  the only hardware input
I have going to the card is the adat lightpipes coming from the behringer
board.  the behringer docs aren't that clear as to how stuff is going out -
is each channel outputting directly out, as if the adat lightpipes are tape
outputs?  or what? it gets a little confusing, you can imagine, if the board
is routing things to multiple outputs.   I'll have to futz with this to
see...
hmm I guess I could take the lightpipes from my old darwin into the hdsp
card too.  this part I can figure out no prob


yeah, I feel ya.  this make sense.  ground up.  I guess I keep going back to
ardour because of not knowing exactly how to see anything - are there
supposed to be meters in hdspmixer?

hmmm.

I think the first step is to get hdspmixer 1.3 to compile, which it's not.
this is quite weird.  you mentioned hdsp.o - I found it and hdsp.c and
friends in /usr/src/redhat/BUILD/alsa-driver-0.9/something/rme9652 (excuse
inaccurate directory, I'm at a different machine), but I don't know if this
has anything to do with things.  I tried moving what is apparently an old
version of hdspmixer out of /usr/bin to /usr/bin/oldhdsp just to get it gone
without actually deleting it, and that didn't effect compiling of 1.3 (I
didn't expect it to)


saving THAT, it seems to me it would be time to skip that and configure the
hdsp with the command line - so I actually expected to see results when I
tried amixer.  but you're right, there needs to be a bit of reset happening.
coming dangerously close to the 'ol red hat reinstall trick ;)




-->><<--__-->><<--

that'll be done next time I go in there, as I had to leave the studio for a
bit and power down :)


ok - we're on the same page on this - (whew! :) ) - I actually sometimes am
more comfortable on the command line and in code.  I wouldn't mind
configuring on the command line and skipping hdpsmixer altogether.  but I
too do like the flashing lights and pretty GUI sometimes :)

;-)

Righto!


how


yes
so summary
configure using amixer commands
get to work
get hdspmixer 1.3 to work
when I open it, expect to see it show up however I've configured the card
using amixer commands

that brings up question.  if I am using amixer commands, skipping hdsp for a
moment, how am I going to test (without opening ardour)?




-->><<--__-->><<--


hdspmixer is really nothign but meters. All of the values that show up
in the GUI are just read from the hardware and displayed, but I promise
you, what's displayed in version 1.2 or lower is not of much value.


I think I mentioned that earlier, and possibly I shouldn't have. Your
system is obviously loading something since you see snd-hdsp in memory.
(lsmod) The *question* was *what version of hdsp.c/hdsp.o is the system
loading? Since you have all the status and control registers, then it
appears you have successfully loaded the version with Thomas's patch.
However, there is a possibility that you are still loading some earlier
version. If you want to be VERY careful, you might take the snd-hdsp
entry out of your modules.conf file, reboot, and then load it by hand
using modprobe snd-hdsp. You would want to make sure you point to the
right one though, which would be where ever you built it.

Also, take a look at
/lib/modules/2.4.20-gentoo-r7/kernel/sound/pci/rme9652

(except change the Gentoo part to your kernel) 

and make sure that the snd-hdsp.o file is the right date. If it is not,
then you might have correctly built the driver but you might still be
loading an older one.



Well, you can see things using amixer, but it has no meters. alsamixer
does nothing with this driver and card, so do not bother with that.

What I did before Thomas and I got hdspmixer working was to use Jack and
Steve Harris's meterbridge to wire up meters for test purposes. That
will work assuming Jack will run for you. Use qjackctl and you'll be
able to wire the meterbridge meters to the ADAT hardware inputs, and the
Ardour outputs for that matter) very easily.

Since you have Ardour working, you could also just use it for input
meters. (This presumes you figure out how to get audio from the mixer to
the Linux box over ADAT.)

I'll be out of touch for the next few hours as I have some networking
problems here that I'm taking care of today.

Good luck!

Cheers,
Mark

ALSA is adding support for these non-standards-compliant USB audio 
devices quickly.  By 0.9.4 the Edirol/Roland UA-20 shows up in 
.../alsa-kernel/usb/usbquirks.h and as of 0.9.6 the UA-5 is there too.  
 From my experience with the UA-5 this means that for 24 bit operation 
the device works strictly as an ALSA device--no OSS emulation available.

Hallo,


Not to be misunderstood: I don't own the UA-20 anymore. I did buy it
when I needed to have it running in about a week. I had hoped, that it
would be just plug and play but for the UA-20 a special quirk is
needed, because it isn't fully compliant to the USB audio spec which
Roland co-wrote. The quirk couldn't be written in less than the week
after which I needed to use this or another USB interface for the LAD
conference, which is absoluetly okay, but didn't help me then ;)

I think, that now the UA-20 works just fine. The Quattro doesn't need
any special quirks so I replaced the UA-20 with a Quattro at my dealer
for the LAD conference. And now I can enjoy 4 channels, great for DJ
work.

Hallo,


For routing OSS or more specific rawmidi devices you need to use
aconnect.  and a snd-virmidi virtual midi card.


Basically this is correct. You didn't give full portnames, though. 

First you need to find out the correct input ports with "aconnect -i"

$ aconnect -i
client 0: 'System' [type=kernel]
    0 'Timer           '
    1 'Announce        '
client 64: 'Rawmidi 0 - M Audio Audiophile 24/96 MPU-401' [type=kernel]
    0 'M Audio Audiophile 24/96 MPU-401'
... 

and then the output ports with "aconnect -o". Your FM synth should
show up here. On my box it looks like this: 

$ aconnect -o
client 64: 'Rawmidi 0 - M Audio Audiophile 24/96 MPU-401' [type=kernel]
    0 'M Audio Audiophile 24/96 MPU-401'
... 
client 73: 'Emu10k1 WaveTable' [type=kernel]
    0 'Emu10k1 Port 0  '
    1 'Emu10k1 Port 1  '
    2 'Emu10k1 Port 2  '
    3 'Emu10k1 Port 3  '
...


Now I can route input coming from 64:0 to output 73:0 to use a
keyboard with the SBLive hardware synth with "aconnect 64:0 73:0".

If you use an ALSA sequencer enabled software like Muse or RG4 you
shouldn't need to fuss with aconnect, BTW. Just configure it inside
Muse or RG4.

If you only need Midi-out from Muse you could start muse with "-a" so

Hi all,

To be honest I'm posting this before investigating all possibilites 
myself, but i'm fast approaching the 'hugely frustrated stage'.

How do I enable the spdif input on my audiophile 2496, please? A bit of 
googling suggested I should change the line in 
/usr/share/alsa/cards/ICE1712.conf from

slave.channels 10

to

slave.channels 20

which should enable input (and disable output since you can't have both 
at the same time on this card.) Correct?

I'm looking at the envy24control mixer settings, and I've unmuted the 
spdif input channels and turned up the sliders, but no input is showing 
on the meters. Is there anything else I should be doing? I haven't got 
an .asoundrc, should I?

thanks, Jordan.

Ok guys so here's one (told ya it wouldn't be long before I was yakkin again - 
I tried to send this earlier but it might have gone bouncy due to html in 
message) - this is for all you MIDI and Ardour experts :)

How about syncing Ardour with MIDI - let's see there's a few different things 
I need to do - 
1) sync ardour to outside tape source via ADAT sync...I set it to ADAT in 
options window, and expect it to wait and play when I play tape, but no cigar

2) sync ardour to outside source via MTC sync - same deal - although if I 
play, and then hit stop, the transport marker sort of sits there waitiing and 
jiggling - does this mean something?

3) sync Ardour to sequencer inside computer - say rosegarden - via MTC I guess 
- whatever works...

anxiously awaiting replies :)  thanks, have fun and yay! :)

Within the Options menu there are flags that can be
set that will cause Ardour to print Midi and MTC
messages to the consol from which it was started. I'd
suggest gettting those messages and sending a report
to ardour-dev.

It's been a long time but I seem to recall controlling
transport from external MTC.

I believe that Ardour 1.0 will abandon MTC generation
in favor of SMPTE--not sure if that applies to reading
external messages. Anyone know?

Ardour generates bursty MTC which isn't very useful
because devices like my Tascam DM-24 can't interpret
it. Apparently SMPTE will be significantly easier to
implement. I'm looking forward to SMPTE because I
desperately need to sync Ardour and a mixer.


The preferred solution for syncing jack clients is
jack_transport functionality. I haven't noticed any of
the midi sequencer developers announcing inclusion of 
Jack O'Quin's new transport feature set. I believe the
API is stable and waiting for people to implement it.
Paul D. recently announced that he has the transport
functionality for Ardour at %80.

I would suggest asking the Rosegarden and Muse
developers if it's on their radar.

I believe you'll find that JAMin and ecasound support
the new functionality. Alsaplayer might too. The old
sync functionality is still supported but obviously
deprecated. So you can probably sync an ecasound,
jamin alsaplayer chain.

-->><<--__-->><<--

hmmm - that's a good idea

I seem to have gotten past this to SOME degree - I repatched my midi patch 
bay, and now ardour responds - but sort of spottily - I usually have to make 
several attempts at hitting play on the outside device (a darwin harddisk 
recorder) before ardour responds.  when it responds, it seems to stay in sync 
well for awhile, although what it won't do is pick up from anywhere but the 
beginning - which is the point of using MTC instead of MIDI clock, 
largely...the problem now is it stops after about a minute, but I think this 
is an issue with recording (as that's what I'm doing) and I'm about to test 
to see if it stops when just playing, and to see if when recording while not 
in sync it stops...


the way I understand it, MTC really just IS smpte, translated into the MIDI 
stream so that MIDI devices such as synths and sequencers (and Darwin, and my 
mixer) can deal with it (my mixer has an actual smpte port too I think) 
it's always nice to have 'em all

I have yet to get ardour to really SEND anything.  it's trying to be a slave 
alright, but I was hoping that it would send ADAT sync (that's the other, 
better way to sync darwins is with the adat 9 pin sync card)...it doesn't 
seem to want to receive ADAT sync either - that might have something to do 
with my card, though - I recall seeing something where the ardour guys 
weren't able to get the ADAT sync to work with the Hammerfall cards yet...


I see this option in the options window of ardour - I thought that might be

what would be really great, actually, is if jack could be the centerpiece for 
sync, and for example, ardour, rosegarden AND external devices could sync to 
jack - having a jack be a solid master time code source sending all sync 
codes out at once, with syncing to it just being a matter of connecting up a 
virtual and/or real cable, 


as I see people talking, it sounds like ecasound might be a better option in 
some cases for initial tracking... but ecasound has no GUI whatsoever, right?

Very much so -- we (Rosegarden developers) simply haven't had time to 
deal with it.  No sync protocol is fully working in Rosegarden yet: 
we had quite a bit of the framework ready a year ago, but have yet to 
find that burst of time and effort to get the bulk of the heavy 
lifting done.

Hmm,

I found the important settings here were found in my brain, and not in

the 'tools' menu in your brain, and uncheck the box marked 'stupidity', 
and then check the box marked 'enable simple logic' then almost as if by 
magic you find the solution to the problem. For those of you more at

Aaron Trumm <aaron-mlH6jWLA/AsAvxtiuMwx3w@public.gmane.org> writes:


Basically true.  The main practical difference between SMPTE timecode
and MTC is that the SMPTE timecode is encoded in an audio stream.  If
digitized and fed to a JACK port, this becomes sample-synchronous,
which can potentially provide excellent timing.  Synching to an
external SMPTE clock will be difficult for many JACK clients because
of clock drift.  But generating SMPTE from within a JACK timebase
master client should be very solid, because then there's only one
clock source.

MIDI messages are generally not delivered with accurate timing by
existing Linux interfaces.  I believe this is why ardour has trouble
with it.

yes, actually I wanted to do this - I figured it would help you, even to

the current report on this issue is that I've now gotten Ardour to record up
to 8 tracks (I haven't tried more) simulatneously while playing 8 more for
over 10 minutes - the change was I unpatched the midi from the darwin to
ardour - I guess it was receiving (or sending and then receiving back?) some
kind of MTC stop?  I'm not sure.  I just know after unpatching MIDI I could
record and it wasn't stopping.  that meant I couldn't sync to the tape and
record though.  (worked around that by sliding new tracks into place)...

yes this sort of confirms what I said in another post, which is that it

the other sample accurate sync (the one I've always trusted the most) is

two years ago i did a bunch of testing on latency to find the best kernel
and patches for my system, and got some damn good results with several
kernels (the best being 2.4.12-ac3-pe (alan cox's patch and pre-emptive
kernel patch using alsa on suse 7.3 with gcc 2.96 20000731).  i now have a
new computer with gentoo linux and alsa 0.9.6, and can only get 16 ms
latency with perfect results.  same soundcard - m-audio audiophile 2496
(ice1712).  i've used kernel 2.4.20 with pe, ll, and some other options,
compiling with gcc version 3.2.3 20030422, and i get the same result with
all of them (as well as without pe or ll).

does anyone know what the problem could be?  alsa version? gcc version? 
kernel version? hardware (eth0 and soundcard share irq - never thought to 
test without eth0 loaded)?  i'd like to get latency under 4 ms.

thanks for your input,
dave

one more note:  i'm using pd (version 0.37 TEST 8) for all my realtime 
audio, and the best i can get it to do is 16 ms latency.  removing eth0

Did you check what IRQ your card was assigned? There's lots of interesting

Performance optimizing is something of a black art. Both the hardware and the

so, it looks like the problem must be with pd.  i'm going to try some

It is a somewhat known problem with Pd. If you use Pd in OSS mode ("pd

better results.  I have no idea and much too little understanding of
ALSA programming, why this is so.

pd-0.37_pre8 = 16 ms

if i set the delay below 12 ms the sound gets distorted (but no xruns

Hi,

I can record from the analogue inputs on my audiophile 24/96 using:

ecasound -i alsawh,0,0 -o whatever.wav

Is it possible to record from the spdif input? I've been googling quite 
a bit, and I don't understand if or how I can relate device or subdevice 
numbers to the spdif input.

(btw, using the latest alsa release).

Thanks, Jordan.




-->><<--__-->><<--
All of those goodies on IRQ 11 is probably what's killing you.  Try
moving your sound card to different slots until it gets an IRQ to
itself.  You really want IRQ 9 or 10 if possible otherwise it's going to
be lower priority than your stuff on IRQ 11.  I didn't really put any
"tricks" per se in the ALSA_JACK_ARDOUR doc just suggestions from Mark
Knecht and others and my own experience with it.  Playing with the
latency setting helps.

Jan








-->><<--__-->><<--


First of all, check you alsa.conf (slocate alsa.conf) to see if it
already has a spdif device listed, mine does.  Try:

cat /location/of/your/alsa.conf | grep spdif

Mine says that...

pcm.spdif cards.pcm.iec958

...is available, so to use aplay as an example, this would mean
something like these:

aplay -D spdif mysound.wav
aplay -Dplug:spdif mysound.wav

Frankly, I'm not sure which one is right or how ecasound does this. 
The ecasound docs and examples are a great place to start.  There is
also someone who has apparenetly dealt wtih your exact problem (OK,
slightly different card) right here:

http://opensrc.org/alsa/index.php?page=1712+.asoundrc

And at the bottom I have posted my own /etc/asound.conf for my Delta
1010.  Channels are accessed for recording or playback by their pcm
name (Ex. arecord -D ice1712_spdif myfile.wav) once they are set up.

I hope this helps.

Yes, I would say that is a latency issue.  On the other hand, since Ardour is multi-threaded, the GUI degrades gracefully.  So it might have started recording even though the record button hasn't popped back.

Hi all,

I've had an interesting discussion with a professor and a distinguished
member of the electroacoustic music community regarding audio latencies
which made me realize that I did not understand the issue in its
entirety. Hence, I looked around the net in order to educate myself.

I soon stumbled across the following site:

http://old.lwn.net/1999/0916/a/latency.html

Admittedly, it's quite old but that, if anything speaks only in Linux's
favor in terms of its pro-audio readiness. At any rate, I was checking
out the benchmark data and was wondering as to how did this
person/software app get to the 0.73ms buffer fragment that is equal to
128bytes? In other words, what sampling rate was used?

128 bytes in 44100Hz sampling rate = 3ms
128 bytes in 88200Hz sampling rate = 1.45ms
128 bytes in 176400Hz sampling rate = 0.725ms (this one being obviously
closest, but at the same time, what kind of hardware supports this
sampling rate, especially in 1999 when this test was done?)
128 bytes in 192000Hz sampling rate = 0.3ms

So what gives? It seems like it is some kind of a 176k-ish sampling rate
that, AFAIK does not exist.

Furthermore, my question is what app was used to produce those
graphs/results and whether these latency tests take into account
hardware latencies (i.e. DSP converters, PCI->CPU->PCI->output etc.), in
other words, is this latency that is achievable with the following
setup:

Input->soundcard->cpu(with some kind of DSP)->soundcard->Output

Your help on this matter is greatly appreciated!

its based, IIRC, on the frequency of the RTC interrupt, which is
always in power-of-2 Hz.


It isn't measuring that kind of latency. Benno wrote a custom program
to measure the ability to satisfy audio interface requirements.
Benno's test program is measuring how rapidly after an audio interface
interrupt it is possible to service the card. this is the "bottom
line" for latency performance - if you can't service the interrupt
quickly enough, nothing else matters. what his test was showing that
we can, from user space, service the card, although his test was based
on using the RTC, which for some hardware will allow you to get even
lower latencies than using the interface's own interrupt. its a hack,
though, and i wouldn't encourage people to do it.

It is there, it just does not have the /proc controlling code activated

in latency...

Hallo,


Yes, it's a problem with Pd's ALSA code. What's even worse than the
latency issue, which I could live with, is that it isn't possible to
select ALSA pcms by name. You're stuck with hw:0, plughw:0, hw:1,
plughw:1, and so on. This basically makes it impossible to use Pd with
asoundrc tweaks and thus with some more advanced multichannel setups
in ALSA mode. These are known problems. I lack the ALSA knowledge
to do anything about it and those who have the knowledge lack the
time, but it would be great if those issues could be sorted out some
time. I'm sure, they will, though.

Are you counting bytes or 16 bit samples, or pairs of 16 bit samples
(stereo L and R) ?

i.e. a stereo signal at 44100Hz sampling rate 16 bit is 4 * 44100
= 176400 bytes/sec.

* Aaron Trumm <aaron-mlH6jWLA/AsAvxtiuMwx3w@public.gmane.org> [Oct 06 03 21:21]:

Of course, think about what is happening: The incoming data is being
buffered by the sound card then delivered to ardour. Ardour then
typically re routes this back via jack to soundcard. You have three
options: 1) lower the latency settings for jack (-p -n) 2) Use a 
card that supports some form of HW monitoring 3) Don't monitor using ardour. 
Note that having a low latency kernel doesn't decrease latency, it
just makes things work more reliably. HTH.

--ant



-->><<--__-->><<--


128 bytes / (44.1 samples/ms * 4 bytes/sample) = 0.7256 ms
16 bit stereo sample = 4 bytes/sample
he was using 3 fragments of 128 bytes, which was giving him a buffer of up 
to 2.1 ms latency.

these results are just with his latencytest program, though.  you need to 
test whatever program you are using to find it's actual results.

with pd, if i set the number of frags to 1 and the fragsize to 128 at a
rate of 48000 it tells me the audiobuffer is 0 ms, 2 or 3 frags is 1 ms,
and 4 frags is 2 ms (i think it's dropping the remainder).  using
latency.pd with these settings gives me 4 ms for 1,2, and 3 frags, and
5.33 ms for 4 frags (with an uncertainty of 1.45 ms).  considering this, 
latency with pd for me is about 2.5 ms, even when stessing the cpu.

another way to test latency is to feed a live sound through a program on 
one channel and then feed it's output, along with another channel of the 
same sound not going through the program, to another soundcard, recording 
this and seeing the time difference in channels using a sound file editor.
you can actually see and hear the latency this way, and not just go off 
some program that gives you ideal or approximate results.

ardour.

hmmm.  I'm using a HDSP9652 - I think it supports hardware monitoring and I
did try it (jackd -d alsa -H right?)

Monitoring doesn't matter all that much, and I was doing #3 - but it's
actually RECORDING late (I was working around last night by sliding the
audio region back after recording)  there's a delay before it gets there.
hmmm it may be because I was using -p 2048 - I needed to do that when I was
first trying to run ardour, but maybe I don't need to now - i have changed
soundcards, kernels and alsa drivers since then ;)

my jack command line was:

jackd -R -a -d alsa -d hw:0 -r 48000 -p 2048 -H

hmmm

Aaron,
   That's quite large. I run at -p 128 most of the time, and sometimes
at 64.

-->><<--__-->><<--


yeah - that's what it took with my other sound card to not play back with
constant glitches and xruns - I'll have to try without that




-->><<--__-->><<--
Yes, give it a try. If your machine is set up well and the card has a
good IRQ (9, 10 or 11 with nothing generating lots of interrupts n front
of it) the my experience with both of my RME cards under Linux is taht
they work quite well. 

:-( I'm having trouble with one Windows ME installation right now that
has my Hammerfall Lite in it. I have a triple boot setup with three
separate installations on it:

1) Planet CCRMA Linux - no xruns, works great
2) Win ME running GigaStudio - works great. no clicks and pops
3) Win ME running Reaktor Session - clicks and pops all over the place

Reaktor takes a lot of CPU power, and this is my slowest box (P3 500) so
I'm thinking that it's just underpowered, but it goes to show that lots
of things effect how well a box works...

:-(

Cheers,

Hi. If I want to resample from 96khz to 48khz, what would give the best
result: use libsamplerate, or just drop off odd (or even) samples?

I guess the libsamplerate and any of its interpolations would cause some
digital garbage anyway, or are they intellectual enough to detect that the
rate is halved and just perform a drop off?

Since I don't know any programs that would just halve the rate by
dropping, I'd have to code it myself, but it shouldn't be too hard.

Any suggestions?

Hi,

Yes, I can also do this with aplay and arecord, however, i was having a 
few overuns with arecord and so decided to try ecasound instead. My 
problem is that I don't know how the "-D spdif" or "-D plug:spdif"  
translates to ecasound flags.

Thanks, Jordan





-->><<--__-->><<--

Dropping samples will give you far worse results than proper interpolation.
Those dropped samples contain useful information, to put it simply.

Thats what it sais on the box anyway.

Yeah I do need the scsi because my only hard drive is plugged into it ;=)
I have no idea why nothing is mapped to 3, 5, or 7. I don't think any 
IRQs are blocked or not enabled, but I've never done any fiddling with 
IRQs before so I could be missing something. I don't remember my bios

Hello All

I'm thinking of buying an M-Audio Revolution for a gaming PC, I've had
great luck with ALSA and my Delta44 in the studio so I'd like to get

output work? What's the word on the current state of surround sound in
Linux?

Sample rate conversion using libsamplerate's SRC_SINC_* converters gives a 
signal to noise ratio of 96dB or better. Yes there is some digital garbage
but its probably less than the noise picked when an instrument is recorded
with a microphone.


On most normal signals, dropping every second sample will sound considerably
worse than what libsamplerate does. I suggest that you read up on sampling 
and aliasing for an explanation of why.

 Strangely enough... so's your sound card.

 We'll assume that also means that you don't need the ide on 15. If you shut off
ide1, the serial and parallel ports {Soundblaster and PAS always use 5 {or 7}
and you can push {reserve} other {isa, unplug and play, etc...} stuff up to the
higher IRQs you may be able to clear up enough space for the Maudio card. {and
your hd} If there are other peripherals that aren't showing up and you don't
need them... turn them off.

 {You don't really need a floppy if that's what the ide thing {I doubt it} is...
I've set up many systems using a cd to boot/rescue with. It's not ever been any
real problem.}

 If your bios really doesn't offer you the option to switch things around you
can always do it in software. I've not run Slackware for 7-8 years... frankly
I've forgotten how. None of the Systems {Suse, Redhat, Mandrake, Debian and lots
of variants and versions {currently, I'm banging my head against the wall with
HURD {it's actually fairly simple... I've just not had the time to read all
of the set up stuff.}} I've run in the past 5 or so years has "given me the
option".

 Slackware's really tough and it's not going to get a lot easier. It's made for
folk that *really* know linux/unix, etc... {and masochists}. My suggestion would
be to either buy or download Redhat, set it up and save the configs for the rest
of the time you own the board. Alternately, {and probably better} there's a very
small Debian distribution that's really easy and pretty sure fire. {Somewhere at
http://www.debian.org } It's ~15o megs and gives you an entire system.
Everything else you can set up over the 'net with dselect or apt-get.
{Stick to stable for a couple months}

Hi, can anyone please tell me exactly what I have to do to get alsa 
digital audio sound output working on kernel 2.6? As you might know 
kernel 2.6 versions come with their own version of alsa supplied, but I 
have tried everything imaginable to try to get digital out sound working 
and have had no luck at all. My soundcard is an onboard via8233 sound 
chip. (Which is extremely common - and as far as I understand it very 
well supported too).

I have compiled in alsa support into the kernel and have selected my 
specific sound card in PCI devices, I have emerged (gentoo speak for 
installed) alsa-utils and alsa-OSS. I aked for advice on several forums, 
but no one seems to have a clue how to get digital out going on this card.

One piece of advice I was given was that I should tell amixer to set 
IEC958 unmute and
amixer set "IEC958 Playback AC97-SPSA" 0.

However when I do that I get a message saying amixer: "Unable to find 
simple control 'IEC958',0" and amixer: Unable to find simple control 
"IEC958 Playback AC97-SPSA" 0

What does this mean?

I also have three mixer channels which I have no idea what they are. 
They are all called "Via DXS". Can anyone exlplain what they do?

If All I want is digital audio output and nothing else, what mixer 
controls should I mute and which should I unmute?

I have been going at this trying to get digital out sound working in 
alsa for 4 weeks now and it's really starting to get me down. Surely 
there must be a way?

All input is appreciated.

Q




-->><<--__-->><<--

 
 :} Quick answer would be to set up Redhat. 
 
 Straight answer would be "I don't know". 

 But... the reason I thought, maybe, I could justify wasting bandwidth is that
after reading this and looking down at the floor at my MOTU firewire card {which
connects to anything with a wire.} It occured to me... What would be wrong with
piping stuff in and out via firewire or USB {or any other sound capable wire}
and using some sort of network sound system?

 ...Probably not a great answer but it's something to consider.




-->><<--__-->><<--
Lol, I'm sorry to have taken up your bandwidth, I surely don't mean to 
use up any more time and resources than you folks can afford.

But 'piping sound out via any other audio capable cable' isn't really 
the answer I was hoping for. SPDIF passthrough - and digital sound in 
general - to an external dolby digital amplifier is a whole different 
kettle of fish than that, as it involves a considerable amount of post 
processing power on behalf of the digital amplifier. There is no true 
5.1 (or indeed 7.1) audio playback - and subsequent channel 
seperation/decoding without some direct form of digital link. Without 
this all you get is a kind of dumb (literally) analoge reproduction of 
whatever the soundcard throws at it. There is no 'intelligent' 
processing at all.

As for installing Red Hat, well I am a Gentoo Linux user... For better 
or for worse that is what I am... It has taken me 4 months to get Gentoo 
set up (its only rival in terms of difficulty to install is I think 
Linux from Scratch) and after having gotten everything else working, I'm 
not in the mood to give up now.

But it does make me wonder... If Redhat could do it, then surely there 
must be a way? If you guys do have any clues, please let me know...

 Firewire and USB are pretty digital. Firewire can cart about huge
 amounts of information accurately and precisely. {DVD sound, video,
 etc...} Both of them are capable of network connections.


 Straight network cables can manage to convey information fairly accurately.
 It seems to me that your "digital" connect is only a conduit for information
 that's encoded and decoded at either end. I'd think the "intelligence" to
 be an attribute attributable to the server and client.
 

 Your external amp *is* doing the processing.


 I'm quite sure it's possible.

No problem. Nice to know it's doing the rounds.

Yes but... that seems to add another whole layer of complexity to what 
already seems like a complex state of affairs. How exactly would I pipe 
sound from a little onboard soundchip to a firewre port? My onboard 
sound doesn't have a firewire port... The only option after that is to 
pump the two remaining analoge sound channels to some kind of box, which 
then had firwire connections going... erm.. where exactly? Why wouldn't 
I just pump the two analoge channels directly to my amp? Except that 
would kind of defeat the purpose of what I'm trying to do.

I think direct digital decoding is still preferable to any exotic 
solution such as 'network sound' or sound somehow pumped through a 
firewire port to somewhere (although sadly my amp doesn't have a 
firewire port either. It would be cool if it did though) though some 
kind of complex arrangement.

I am sure a 'conventional' arrangement should be possible. The question 
is, as it was before, how?

Q







-->><<--__-->><<--

Yes, I've used it, but it's not even in the same game, much less the
same league. I think the much more similar might be something more like
AMS, which I admit I haven't used. It looks quite good though.

It does raise an interesting point for me though. The reason I went with
Reaktor Session and not Reaktor is that I do NOT want to program sounds.
I just wanted to get a bunch of preprogrammed synths and find some new
sounds that I could use, which I was able to do in about 10 minutes of
installation. 

The neat thing (for me anyway) about Reaktor is the on-line user
contributed library of about 1500 prebuilt synths that come with, on
average, maybe 10 preprogrammed patches. That's a lot of stuff to get on
day one. Why isn't something like that happening in the Linux soft synth
area? Instead of having so many soft synths, which seems more a focus on
writing software, why not more sounds for some existing soft synth,
which seems more a focus on making music?

I think we Linux soft synth users should try to make that happen.

but my motherboard (kt400-alh) has analog 5.1 output, no digital.  i can 
try to see if that option works under linux, thoough, if you think it will 
help you.

also, make sure you are using a proper spdif cable (75 ohm, i think), and 
not just any rca cable as it won't work.  i wish i could find one of those 
here in korea.

i've just been through this myself on an Asus A7...? motherboard.
I found it very educational installing Gentoo, and i think its v good,
but man did it take me a long time! 

i tried 4 kernels and 4 versions of alsa and failed to get the via82xx
sound working properly. After 2 days i gave up and it took about 10 mins
to get a soundblaster working.

i could be wrong but my feeling is the drivers for the via82xx are not
good. I have had lockup problems in the past, but currently have it working 
fine for Gnomemeeting on an older mobo with alsa 0.9.0 (analogue)




first it would be good if you could prove that digital out
is actually implemented on your mobo. Have you had it working on
older kernels or other OS's? Knoppix?
Do you know for sure where the dig output comes out? separate panel?
What are you using to test it?
Do you have analogue out working?
Is your outboard amp getting a carrier signal?



i hate to say it but these mixers are not very helpful, and
i find trial and error to be the best method. Run alsaplayer
and try every possible combination. Often the controls dont do
what you think, or what they are labeled as :-)

which mixer are you using? you may find gnome-alsamixer or similar to
be slightly more friendly than alsamixer.


good luck with this. however, unless you're broke or are prone to
geek perversity (not necc a bad thing!), perhaps the best advice would
be to get a cheap pci card.

I think you're probably right, although of the thousands I wouldn't venture
a guess as to how many of those are warez types. More than NI might want to
admit.

That said, Reaktor Session comes with 35-40 prebuilt instruments, and each
instrument has many sounds ready to go. It comes with a large library of
wave files built into the instruments, but they can be extracted and reused
elsewhere. I think the method to that madness is that NI creates enough
usability out of the box to get users really turned on to create more. Then
the library comes, which benefits all the users again.

I'd love to see that happen with one or more of the Linux tools. I simple
don't have the time or interest to become a programmer. When I turn on my PC
and try to write music I need tools that get me there faster. I don't want
to spend an hour grabbing blocks and wiring them together. By the time I get
that done I've lost my inspiration for making music.

I may be the odd man out around here. I'm not sure...

I think the strength of Reaktor is the resources in that central 
program.  Right now in Linux we have Pd which is probably the closet to 
it and a bunch of synths that are seperate and different from each 
other.  It seems we need a similar program in terms of functionality. 
 Ams is probably close, but its not multi-timbral, multi-channel, or is 
it.  Like it or not, Reaktor works but I wouldn't go back into that big 
money arena again if you gave me the money!

-->><<--__-->><<--
Well thanks.. I would certainly appreciate any help anyone can offer. 
Yes I would have to say I agree with you on the Red Hat thing, although 
I was anxious not to piss off a lot of Red Hat users, particularly as 
this set up did work for sound in Red Hat. But I just couldn't cope with 
the dependency hell of Red Hat or any other RPM based distribution, so I 
started looking for an easy to manage distribution that would let me 
install and unistall software and updates without any of that hassle. 
Gentoo portage was that magic formula and after using it for a short 
while I was permenantly won over. It is a little ironic maybe that the 
easiest to use package management system in the Linux world comes 
included in the hardest to install linux distribution in the Linux 
world. (Slackware is nothing compared to Gentoo...) But oh well there 
you are. The end result is certainly worthwhile. It may have taken me a 
while to get my head around it, but persistance pays dividends and I 
came out of it knowing a lot more about Linux than I could have learned 
any other way.

But as I said, I have never had sound and full 3D video working in any 
distibution I have tried (which is about eitht I think). right now I 
have every other feature working sweetly - except sound...

If I could have sound I think I would celebrate by wiping all my windows 
partitions and instantly switching my 460GB of music, movies and games 
over to ext3 partitions. I want to be done with Windows and MS by this 
years end. Having sound would be a big step towards this goal.

Q

PS

As for SPDIF cable. That isn't really an issue. I have high quality 
optical cable, which although in terms of benefit is probably only of at 
best an aesthetic value, at least gurantees a clear signal. (I assume 
you know that difference between optical and coaxil digital out is 
virtually irrelevant? In other words, it doesn't matter which of these 
is connected to the SPDIF out).

Again any input anyone can offer on this would be much appreciated. It 
would for me be the culmination of a long held goal now (of over a year) 
to have both sound and video fully working in Linux.

Hi,

Wednesday 08 October 2003 16.40 skrev Mark Knecht:

I was going to reply to a previous message on this thread with the intention 
of saying that the problem might be that there are no sites/channels where 
one can share patches or similar in the linux audio world...
But after seeing the new layout of Noizefarm 
http://devdsp.net/index.pl?main=noizefarm 
I'd say this isn't an argument anymore...  looks great!

It could probably do better in the advertisement area though... unless I was 
the last one to know??

Even if we are fewer people in the linux-audio comunity I do think, especially 
with our open source background, that we are very keen on sharing what we 
create. 

Another possibility is, of course, that nothing IS being created on any 
grander scale, because the programs aren't production ready. I only have to 
go to myself and my own trials at creating music in a linux environment and 
all the hoops I have to hop through at the moment! It definately has some 
truth to it.


Unfortunately you still are. 
Most of us would definately like that to change... and it probably is... but 
it's happening slowly...

Red Hat apt-rpm that elimintates the dependency problem.  I am not
promoting Red Hat.  I just think all distros are really the same once

Hi Mark:

  I think you raise some good points. They've been raised before, maybe 
many times over the last few years, but they do indicate how far we 
still have to go before the average *musician* will forsake his Win/Mac 
tools for the Linux kit. As another "odd man out", I really don't worry 
much about it, probably because most of my music-making is still done as 
a live performer with tools like a guitar, a PA, and my voice, along 
with other live players (the dead ones never make the gigs ;). I don't 
use the computer on my jobs, nor do I plan to.

  However, obviously a lot of people would like to make Linux their 
music-making platform of choice, but our current lack of GUI sex appeal 
and the general attitude of "Linux is still a bit too difficult for me" 
work against a swelling of the ranks in Linux audio *users*. It's 
probably safe to say that at this time most of the active users _are_ 
the developers. I like the visionary aspect of it all, but I know that 
the majority of computer-based music-makers are utterly non-interested 
in becoming developers (as you say, you'd rather develop music than 
software). Linux audio developers might best be considered as the 
architects of a foundation for a wonderful future, which is hardly 
consolation for the average musical Joe who wants to turn on, tune in, 
and rock *now*.

  All that being said, I am very impressed with the whole JACK 
development strategy, the evolution of Ardour, Csound going LGPL, 
Kjetil's vstserver, Steve Harris's LADSPA plugins, Miler's awesome PD, 
PlanetCCRMA/AGNULA, and even some of the newer Linux softsynths. IMO 
we're already far beyond the "toy" stage and we're moving forward at a 
respectable rate. Much of the available Linux audio software is usable 
right now, though there is indeed still a long path ahead before it

  Anyway, I'm rambling. Sinus infection, wrecked laptop, hard-disk 
failure, bad tooth, WINE headaches... maybe I'll just switch back to 
Win98 and end it all... ;)

that'll make two members of the original cast of "Predator" who have

Clients do give you the money. Do 10 minutes of music for a TV show or a
commercial or whatever and you'll easily earn the $200 required to pay for
the tool on your first job.

That said, I know very little about Pd, but would like to learn. Looking at
the Noize Farm site I see that there is a lot of stuff there for Pd, so I
should probably spend some time with it. (And I will!)

I really think the Reaktor vs. Reaktor Session products was a very smart
move by NI. They know their customers. Some, most probably early adopters
with ideas like yours above, want Reaktor because they want to get in and
get messy. On the other hand, there are a lot of people out here that don't
care about that at all. We just want to turn the box/program on, use it for
what it is, and make some music. I'll tweak a knob here or there, but I
don't have the patience to sit and look at all of NI's little knobs and
fonts. I'd go either nuts or blind very quickly.

However, underlying both products is the same engine. In Reaktor Session I
cannot make new instruments, but I can use any instrument built in Reaktor.
It's a great solution for me.

I see no reason at all that Pd couldn't do the same thing...

BTW - This isn't a software only view for me. I played a DX-7 for a couple
of years (still have it in my garage after 20 years) and I never programmed
a single patch. I just used it as a tool.

Dave,
   Great post. Not a word I disagree with.

   There really is a difference between when goes on here and what goes on
in business. Native Instruments drives their business to produce what they
believe is a real product, which they sell for real money. They look at
whatever they think the market is and they address its needs. If they do,
they make money. If they don't, someone else will and NI goes under. Darwin.
(And very little concern for young musicians, kids really, who are trying to
get started, have all the energy and no money. Too bad.)

   This Linux world is completely different. No one is going to *make* Paul,
Taybin, Jesse, Steve, Chris, Guillaume or Rich do anything. (Or the 500
other people I haven't mentioned.) They get to create the vision they have,
and then we users get to use it if we want to. It's a great model when it
works, and I think it often does, but not always, and not so far in all
areas.

   For me, my little project studio is now 2 Windows boxes and 1 Linux box.
The Linux box is the only one that's on 100% of the time. Nothing gets done
without it anymore. That's a lot more Linux than I used a year ago.

   In the last year I've probably spent $1K-$2K on software. It's all been
Windows software. As a user, I'd buy Linux apps if they existed and did what
I needed them to do. As a user I have very few options in this area.

   I see Linux and Windows coexisting in my studio forever, or at least
until Windows becomes irrelevant. ;-)

Cheers,
Mark

ahhh ha yes true true but that implies that it's a given you can LAND those
jobs, which makes me giggle :)





-->><<--__-->><<--

True, but not a complete description.
As a user, you have direct contact via email and mailing lists with 
all of these developers. And while they are perfectly free to ignore
you, there is a cultural bias in the free software world in favor
of being responsive to one's user communty :-)

Remember that no one is going to *make* Steinberg, Digidesign, etc etc 
do anything either. They have a vested interest in giving you enough
of what you want that you keep coming back for more; but if you need
something that isn't a popular feature you're out of luck and
it is impossible to do anything about it. At least with free software
there is a chance that you can find somebody to help you get what
you need.

I was once on a very active user group for a Yamaha sampler that 
I owned. We collected a detailed list of features and improvements 
we'd like to see in a revised version of the ROM for the sampler. 
Some of these were extravagant, but some were quite simple 
useability enhancements that should not have been technically 
difficult at all. We managed to get in touch with some people 
at Yamaha. They basically told us we were out of luck, but if we'd 
like about a quarter of the fixes on our list, we could always fork over 
twice as much money for the replacement device they were coming out 
with, which would probably never do everything we wanted either, 
and would probably have a similar lifecycle: get some of what 
you want... expensive upgrade which *removes* some of your favorite 
features while adding others... repeat infinitely.

Thank god free software doesn't work that way.


Sure. The major limiting factor is developer time.

I like hearing that. :)

Sadly (?), all attempts at commercial Linux audio software have failed, 
with the sole exception of 4Front (and I believe they're still here 
because they wisely diversified to provide audio drivers for a variety 
of *NIX platforms). IMO it's a classic double bind: few users mean 
little commercial potential, while lack of commercial apps (especially 
the existing powerhouses) stifles any potential for an existing user 
community to move to the new platform.

The bells have tolled for the Ceres soundfile editor (*not* the Ceres of 
NoTAM fame), the Jazz++ MIDI sequencer (now GPL'd but perhaps too late 
for a strong development interest), and the Ultramaster RS101. The TAON 
soundfile editor was a promising piece back in 1999, but the authors' 
insistence on closed sources inhibited community involvement, and when 
they graduated from school the project went belly-up, with no possible 
life-support from its users. And God knows how long I cajoled Boris 
Nagels about releasing the sources for his Multitrack, to no avail.

Sometimes I worry about things like Stefan Nitschke's very cool RTSynth 
(free, but closed-source) or the Bros. Hayward's STEEM project (though 
they plan on going GPL sometime in the future). Those projects are 
wonderful, but if their maintainers disappear or simply lose interest, 
we lose some very nice software. I know, we don't really lose it 
completely, but it dies the death as far as development is concerned. 
Given the dependency hell that is Linux, you never know when the next 
kernel release will break binary compatibility with such apps, leaving 
the user with the uncomfortable choice of remaining behind the OS curve 
or abandoning the tools. Lose/lose.

But not to worry much. We have ecasound, we have Ardour, and these are 
fantastic tools, 'way beyond what I had any right to expect back in 
1999. And things are getting better here all the time. Recently I sync'd 
SoundTracker, ecasound, and Hydrogen via the JACK transport. Yeh, it's 
got some problems, but fundamentally the scheme works, and the 
particular developers are all dedicated to making it *really* work. I'm 
getting happier...

One of my favorite cautionary tales re: closed sources regards the 
beautiful version of M produced by Voyetra in the late 80s. Apparently 
the original coder simply walked off with the sources, so even Voyetra 
no longer has access to the code. And has anyone else ever wondered what 
happened to the code base for Opcode's Studio Vision ?

Btw, I've been testing some Windows apps for WINE compatibility. I have 
Buzz working now, and the WINE AppDB lists at least one user who claims 
to have run Reaktor under some version of WINE. Just FYI... I'll have to 
check for a Reaktor demo to test...

Maybe we need to lobby the folks at Crossover or WineX to consider 
versions of their products optimized for running Windows audio/MIDI apps 
? Obviously I'd prefer users to simply switch to the Linux equivalents, 
but at least you wouldn't have to write off your considerable investment 
in Windows software.

Hallo,

[...]

I'm working on making exactly this happen with Pd. At least it is one
of my current goals. Technically Pd allows for a very interesting
thing with its graph-on-parent patches. Basically this is a Pd patch
that carries its own GUI. You can see some very early screenshots of
these in my angriff drum machine for Pd here:
http://footils.org/cgi-bin/cms/?show_article=13

What GOP allows is, that more experienced users could build real
easy-to-use instruments for the casual, musician type users.  I
already coined a marketing term for this: (drum roll...) 
   
   RRAD-ical Pd 
   
where RRAD stands for "Reusable and Rapid Audio Development". This is
only half joked. Even Max/MSP, which is far more complex than Reaktor,
has much more users than any Linux tool, and the main reason, the
secret is, that the many users of Max do build and share (or sell)
many useful instruments. The same applies to Csound.

I want to help build the same for open source software.  Pd is a
natural choice for me, because I like and use it a lot, but it is also
one of the more widely used "synth" applications available for Linux,
maybe because it also is crossplatform and available on Win and OS-X,
too. 

Pd might not be the prettiest software or have the cleanest app
design, but it is there, it works and - most importantly - it has a
community around it. 

As none of the open source audio tools really is backed by a company
which could force its employees to build patches, write docs or which
could sponsor musicians to use its products, the community is the main
and only 'selling' point.

I really wish more people would contribute patches to the Noizefarm. 

Having more presets and patches is fundamental for making our software more usable, and it's not always the program authors that are the best people to do this. I'd really encourage anybody who wants to contribute and who can't program to post patches on the noizefarm, or make them generally availible. 

Also it follows the whole GPL philosophy of sharing of modifications, I'm suprised it's not more popular.

Another thing I'd like to see is more people showing off the music they've made with this stuff, it makes a good impression to people thinking of trying linux if they can hear what other people have done.

Moaning over :) but maybe there really aren't enough of us...

Ah! Thankyou very much, you lead me to the answer. I haven't got an

Ah screw it, I'm giving up and buying a Terratec Aureon 7.1 soundcard in

supported digital in and digital out sound.

The only problem is, what is the module name for these cards? All 
refference to module names for any soundcard appears to have been 
removed from the alsa site...

How will I know what module/s to load if I have no idea of the module name?

For the sake of offering an alternative view, I've found Slackware to be a *much* better distro for a hands-on learner like me.  I never really got into Linux very deeply until I switched over to Slackware.  Believe it or not, I think you have to know *more* in order to use Redhat or Debian for audio.  The simple reason is that the other distros introduce so many non-standard behaviors, that I could rarely even complete a simple HOWTO without some cryptic error message popping up.  Now that I've switched to Slackware, OTOH, things generally work right from the start.  Even Cinelerra, which (according to the web site) is supposed to be difficult to build from source, compiled without complaint and runs without a hitch.  Your milage may vary, of course ;)

damn i was hoping you might be able to get to the bottom of this

do you know which chipset it uses?
the output of lspci will hopefully tell you.
you can then match it against the list of modules (in /lib/modules/...).

if you are lucky alsa may just load the correct module anyway..

I know it's anathema to some folks here, but I'll suggest it anyway: 
patch randomizers. If PD or SSM or AMS or ZASF each had patch 
randomization controls I'd find it easier to create more patches. 
Constrained patch randomization is an especially nice touch.

(My apologies to the authors of those synths if such controls already 
exist.)

I created hundreds of useful sounds for my TX802 and TX81Z by using such 
controls in editors like Voyetra's Sideman series.

Programming synth patches from scratch implies a lot of knowledge 
regarding any particular synthesis method. It takes time, and I consider 
it a craft, definitely worth pursuing *if you have the time to do so*. 
But using a patch randomizer to generate, say, a dozen variants on a 
basic piano sound, that doesn't require much beyond an ear capable of 
nice judgement and some knowledge about general synthesis basics 
(amplitude envelope functions, velocity response, etc.)

The same applies to effects patches, and IIRC there's now a 
randomization control available for LADSPA. Maybe Steve H. can elaborate 
on its utility ?

Most of the members of this list are aware of this page:

    http://linux-sound.org/music.html

I'll be adding a couple new items to it next release, and I welcome any 
new links or updates. Some of the titles there are pretty cool, 
definitely show-off stuff for people who want to hear music made with 
Linux audio tools.

There's never enough... ;)

Hmm... perhaps this is why Linux isn't as prolific on the consumer

as a FOSS advocate might hope?

All seriousness aside, I don't quite know how to help you.  One
possibility
to entertain is that the current set of kernel-integrated drivers might
be borked
up.  If it's not hernia inducing, consider compiling another kernel from
the
2.4.X series and using an older version of ALSA with it; you could
boot this one beside your normal kernel. This worked
for me when I was assembling my brother's computer and faced some
serious problems getting his onboard sound to work. YMMV.

Hallo,


It's Sourceforge. This problem should be resolved soon, as SF is
installing and enabling new servers, but until then you don't have
much choice but to retry it several times. Like: 

$ while ! cvs update; do sleep 5 ; done

or so.

Thanks for that.... but I've just discovered that ecasound records 
without any of the problems I was experiencing with arecord, so I'll 
save your advice for when/if I get any other related problems :)

Oh btw, I did use Mandrake, and briefly Redhat for about 18 months 
before I switched to Slackware, and to be honest I prefer Slackware... I 
haven't had that much trouble setting things up how I want, ok 
occasionally I have to plough through a few docs but thats not a bad 
thing in the long run. (Debian does sound nice too, i agree).

regards, Jordan.




-->><<--__-->><<--

sorry, cant let that pass :-)

if you want it to be, system installation can be very
easy indeed. Mandrake install is almost completely brainless.
Knoppix is also a good example of how good it can be.

'consumers' shouldnt use a devel kernel on gentoo with
poor quality hardware:-)

of course apps is another matter....


ok i feel better now. cheers.

hello all - is there a cd recorder that can record audio cds to an ide cd 
recorder driver?

I have xcdroast, which doesn't seem to do audio - it has an option to play 
audio files from the harddrive (and doesn't see my soundcard and I can't 
figure out how to load audio files anyway - weird)

and I have of course the command line cdrecord - but that seems to only deal 
with scsi drives - right?  

hmmm

thanks!

I think it should be without the pcm.

the pcm. just defines the type and spdif is the name

Aaron,


	XCDRoast does burn audio CDs.  You have to use TAO (zero pregap is
best) instead of DAO.  Put the wav files in the image directory that you
normally burn from and they should show up with cute little music notes
next to them ;-)


Jan







-->><<--__-->><<--

try putting this to ~/.asoundrc

spdif_cap {
        type plug
        ttable.0.8 1
        ttable.1.9 1
        slave.pcm {
                type hw
                card 0
                device 0
        }
}

This assumes Audiophile 2496 is card 0

Then try:

ecasound -i alsa,spdif_cap -o alsa,plughw:0

or -o test.wav, but with the former you can monitor your spdif from the
analog outputs (of course you can do the same with envy24control and
setting the hw outs to spdif, from the patchbay/router)

Some quick notes...

You might want to read this article:

    http://linux.oreillynet.com/pub/a/linux/2001/01/05/record_cd.html

Don't mind the first part, the second section is what you want to read. 
Follow the pointers to the various other articles, you'll be burning CDs 
like a pro in no time.

Most Linux distros accomodate IDE drives by emulating SCSI. What 
distribution are you using ?

Run this command (as root) to see how your system identifies your CD-RW:

    cdrecord -scanbus

	i'd like to chime in here, just to give a completely 
different perspective, and the problems i have encountered. this is 
long personal history, feel free to delete (those not on digest!)


	first thing that is majorly different is that i am a 
macintosh user, and have been for some 15 years now. that's not where 
i started in computers, but it is in computers used for music. i have 
always enjoyed the usability and abaility to individually configure 
the platform and, for a long time, felt like the attitude of the 
software makers and users of this platform was in line with my own 
attitudes on computers and music; which is to say: an ideal of 
futurism and creativity, extending from xerox PARC to the 21st 
century.
	of course things changed. apple has become a very strange 
company (and slightly greedy - though now i hear they are below 3% of 
the market share, so maybe i would be too...) and MS windows has 
become ubiquitous as a non-business platform simply by virtue of the 
fact that once so many people were indoctrinated into its use via 
work-related computing it was easier for them to move to a home PC in 
that same realm.
	luckily for me, working in california in music and film 
production, i have been able to stay in the macintosh arena - despite 
what the european music software manufacturers would have us believe, 
most film and cd media manufactured and sold around the world during 
the 1990s was ultimately made, assembled, mixed or produced in its 
entirety in some combination of avid-controlled software running on 
macs.
	i say luckily, because i came to really dislike working in 
any microsoft software: it seems opaque to me, and the organization 
is diffcult. plus it's so obvious that the window interface is a poor 
copy of the macintosh's direct descendent of the dynabook ideal. like 
the start-from-below as opposed to from-above. (plus i like a command 
key under my thumb..)  so it's not about GUI (though i am partial now 
to mac after much accustomization) so much as organization.
	anyway, that's just where MY brain is at. several years ago i 
split the full time entertainment industry for academia and the avant 
garde (back to my roots! although i am still a professional musician 
and tour and record several months out of a year.) so i finally took 
the time to reeducate myself in the computer world, to get beyond 
sequencers and digital-audio workstations. that brought me back to 
synthesis, which for the intervening years--post buchla-and-moog--had 
been rack-mount yamaha or emu items. (although it should be noted 
that when i was working on film sound design i did use maany 
manipualation tools like soundhack or metasynth...)
	my present main arsenal for making music on mac, both for 
studio and live performance, shows: max/msp, supercollider (2 and 3), 
reaktor (see reviews i have written for MIT CMJ) and protools.  as 
well, there are several other apps of course, but less usage on the 
whole. i run mac os X almost exclusively (unless i need to do 
something in supercollider 2). i like OS X. really! sadly, the gui is 
taking more cpu and causing things like max/msp to have timing 
problems! things like this are being ironed out slowly, and with new 
computers, we hope we get the chance to have things work properly. 
more sadly than that, however, is the wholesale abandonment of the 
platform by various manufacturers - clavia's synth patch editor for 
example, has no OS X version, nor is there one planned. so if i need 
to edit patches in the hardware, i need another OS. and RME, well, 
they're just so self righteously anti-macintosh that i feel bad for 
having bought the multiface.

	so... linux. why, you may ask? there are several reason for 
me. one is that i like computers. a lot. it seems like linux users do 
too. another is that the aformentioned "idealistic attitude" of 
futurism, creativity and also cooperativity exists in the linux 
community, where it is becoming lost elsewhere. this attitude, as it 
were, is extremely important to me in choosing what i work with, 
perhaps despite difficulties in doing so. still another reason is 
that i fear the macintosh being put out of business by microsoft (or 
apple shooting themselves in the foot), in which case i want an 
alternative. as for the price, well. that seems less important.  a 
cheap system is cheap, but a good system is still expensive. the 
points about market-driven development of software are well taken - 
if you want to use the same thing as everybody else. i have some itch 
to make my  own patches in modular synths (though i really appreciate 
looking at other people's code/patches to learn how to. great thanks 
to ssm and ams - especially after i found out about the 
/usr/share/ams folder was and what it contained, for example.)

	so i started by converting old ppcs to yellowdog. i 
immediately realized that the makers of the linux desktop gui 
environments were coming from PC backgrounds! almost all remind me of 
windows parodies. and while PD is probably beautiful and powerful, it 
sure is ugly compared to max/msp (sorry if that is offensive to 
anyone). anyway, i moved from there to a debian-ppc system, which i 
liked better, got alsa to work (!) and it made noise so i finally 
bought a pieced together pentium system and installed planet-ccrma. 
easy install, difficult to make it work with its built in sound chip 
- still haven't made sound without digital clicks (the final problem: 
can't change the IRQ of the VIA82xx snd card from it's position where 
it lives with a usb hci and eth0 -- is this really information that a 
studio user/musician needs to be aware of...?*), but at least i am 
now much more familiar with what's available and what applications i 
will use. next time i have several hours, i'm going to reread the 
archives of this list to figure out how to reconfigure my system for 
the rme multiface. -anybody write up the final how-to?

(to the above list i should mention that i burned a july '03 iso of 
knoppix-ppc to check on my powerbook and it's really good! very 
impressive interface and immediate hardware and file system 
accessibility. very nice. still having a hard time with getting the 
ccrma-redhat networked to see the hfs+ files..)

	so, i can see that the massive amounts of configuration 
needed to make a linux system work in a studio environment will be 
daunting to most users. i don't think anybody in *my* immediate 
working environment (band, studio, college) would be able to do it**. 
that combined with learning the new structure of the file system 
(where is this app? where are its libraries? where are the 
files/patches for it kept? how do i make it work?) make it a daunting 
task for any lay user of the more popular windows/mac 
softsynths/sequencers etc. to navigate. i really don't see how this 
could be made any easier immediately. the result is that it is going 
to take determined individuals to use the audio applications for the 
time being. but this means people that actually care enough to use 
them and help out other to do so as well! and hopefully that attitude 
will gather more users, but the people on the inside have got to 
realize how far they are from the people on the outside in terms of 
familiarity with the system in general. even i take some of these 
things for granted, once they are learned. zero-conf is probably the 
only way to get the masses to do anything!

anyway, so here you have another perspective of somebody burrowing 
into linux audio from another route. thanks for reading and 
considering another's perspective.

well, as my subject line says, I'm wondering about sysex dumping and receiving 
- I always used to do it in Cakewalk to save synth setups or dump patches to 
the synths, etc.

now I'm not seeing such a function in rosegarden (which is the only program 
I've got to run so far - oh I haven't tried kmidi I'll do that)

is sysex implemented in any sequencers, or is there a stand alone?  

thanks! :)

 The concept is close. :} And it is a linux package.


 It seems to me that a concerted effort towards a consistent linux sound
development system is what we need. ...Rather than more editors... some effort
needs to go into making existant editors and sequencers more usable, more
extensible, more easily extensible and more compatible... with "parts" that can
move between them.

 {like plugins but this might also apply to interface elements and libraries
{like ReaKtor and like vst and synthedit and studioware.} ...things that users
can mix and match and build with to put together a whole music development
system of their own}

 As far as I'm concerned making sounds is part and parcel of making electronic
music. I don't have any problem with that. {I have a problem with keeping them
organized {for me an ideal system might be based on a file manager}} I need
synths to create sequences and manipulate sound files. {As I've mentioned in the
past... I have more sounds than I can deal with {almost all original. most
needing to be "finished", properly looped, etc. {I've taken a few major hits in
that regard due to our recent windows virus plague, a few script kiddies and
some related hardware failures {if my video editor locks up it takes the system
out with it {sometimes literally} in recent months {I'm out 4 {possibly six
{all of them full}} hard drives since around May} 


 We need organization, standards, a "drag and drop" mid level development system
{Like Reaktor or synthedit} and easy distribution {I'd suggest something
distributed like gnutella or turbosquid but I think it needs to be up 24/7 and
centralized {and organized}}. Stuff like sample libraries, soundfonts, etc could
be easier for folk that don't have time or are otherwise engaged. Dselect
and debian packages would be ideal

 Yeah... "music" needs to be the focus.





-->><<--__-->><<--

afaik there is no explicit support for it.

you didnt say what synths you are using, but any realtime
midi sequencer should be able to just record the sysex
for later playback back into the synth. I no longer have
any outboard synths so i cant test, but worth a try if you 
havnt already...


cheers!

 What's the difference?

 Same here {all counts} I don't think the development model works that way
though. If there were just a way of funneling the cash from server sales to
linux audio... 



-->><<--__-->><<--


 What if this sort of thing were implemented as a closed source shareware
 module that plugged into a whole system? 

 



-->><<--__-->><<--

as I'm googling around, I've read a couple of things about being able to do
cat <sysexfilename> >/dev/midi00

but that has not yet worked :)


actually right now I'm trying to dump qcard (programs, aka patches, aka 
instruments aka sounds baby :) ) sysex files into an alesis s4 (the 
quadrasynth rack mount version) - it's the S4, not the S4 plus - which makes 
it a bit old :)  so I have .SYX files - in cakewalk, I would go to the sysex 
screen, and choose import, and import the .syx file into its sort of buffer, 
and then just choose send, and the S4 would wake up and do a little dance and 
then the info would be there...

I also stumbled upon mention of DOS emulation that would allow running of DOS 
applications - that tickles my fancy because my preferred sequencer has been 
Cakewalk 5.0 for DOS for almost ever :)

 Hardly... firewire is about as simple as it gets.


 Does your board?


 You can get firewire enabled amps. {Av, surround, etc} There may be a decoder
of some sort.


 This would be networked digital. You could even do video with it.

 Aside from your peripherals.


 Debian makes upgrading and setting up new software much too simple. :}

 Redhat is far too limited. Their hardware setup stuff is excellent though.






-->><<--__-->><<--

I totally agree. Started with Debian 2.2, tried Mandrake, RedHat, and now 
Slackware. This is where I am staying. I feel totally in control of my 
system, I know exactly what is running, and how it is started and stopped, 
I can break a package open to fetch one file without having to install the 
whole damn thing, and even rebuild it again without having to write some 
criptic file just to tell the package manager that something should be done 
when the package is installed etc.

I also like the fact that all the setup programmes, eg the installation and 
configuration, is all written in bash scripting, using the dialog programme 
to make it interractive. Installation programmes written and compiled are 
more of a problem IMO, as if you have a problem, you can simply open the 
script file, find the spot with the problem, and make a modification on the 
fly, and continue with the running of the script.

 I used Slackware, minilinux, minix and a few alternative Unices when I first
started with linux. To be fair to Slackware I've not used it since. Debian
turned out to offer me exactly what I wanted.


 :} Most distributions have their own docs. Debian adheres pretty closely to the
standards.


 I've not gotten it to compile on anything. I've managed to get the binaries to
work on everything. I need the Canopus codec for several reasons. I'm stuck in 
windows to do editing. I use linux for other than editing at the moment.
Eventually, I'll move everything to linux. At the moment I'm not willing to do
both.

 There are a couple of editors for it. You might check the linux sound pages.

 How you missed gnome, kde, etc is beyond me.
 Go to dselect and download xfm... you should be happier.

In fact, both GNOME and KDE in their out of the box 
configurations might look a whole lot like Windows to a Mac 
user... though I have to admit I'm surprised yellowdog didn't 
set up a more familiar looking default (maybe to avoid legal 
threats from Apple, but they do exist.)

Both have a context menu on the top left and minimize, maximize, 
close on the right, for example, and the widgets tend to be a 
lot more "metal with highlight and shadow" than either OS9 or 
OSX.  Again, that sort of thing can be tweaked with themes but 
last I knew, Mac users don't get into themes quite as much as 
Linux or Windows users.

Would this really be any easier with another distro? Bearing in mind 
that all I've tried so far with Slackware is swapping the slots which my 
sound card and ethernet card are plugged into, and now things seem to 
work with ecasound anyway ( i did  another thread in the archives that 
said that arecord is only intended as a demo app and shouldn't be relied 
on for serious work, which would explain why it gave me problems.)

 I'm using kde with icewm on this system. You can set it up any way you like
{tho' right now that's pretty similar to windows {riscos windows with the b3
style and strangely enough... the osx icon pack. :}}}

 There are clones of Aqua for just about everything... It would be fairly easy
to emulate osx pretty closely.

 I think I'm going to go with GNUstep on my debian system and in HURD {same
system {drive} actually}}. I found a bunch of OpenStep apps the other day that
have been ported to it {Mach}. With a little tweaking it should make for a nice
NEXT/OSX/linux/OpenStep hybrid.

Hallo,


Actually I found this a very interesting read. Regarding the Mac
ergonomics: I think, that this also has to do a lot with what you are
used to. 

At work (web stuff) we considered switching to Macs a year ago. My
colleagues are "highly trained" in Windows and some (me obviously)
also in Linux and we just sat in front of the Mac and didn't know how
to use it.  Literally: I felt like a child again, because everything
was so strange and so "something else". We didn't buy more than the
first two Macs because it really would have hurt our productivity for
several weeks. This is not meant to flame the Mac's ergonomics, which
in theory seem to be much better worked out but if you are used to
something else, than it really is difficult to switch.


OS9 in our office could stay up for a long time before it crashed.
OS-X is generations better. 


That's what I also think. And it's why I still use an old-school setup
with ls, rm, mv and cp as my file manager. You can pry my command
prompt from my dead fingers, KDE. ;)


No offense. There is a saying, that Pd is the uglier, but smarter
sister of Max. But this has a reason: Pd is at version 0.37. This is
still far away from a version 1.0. It is planned to make Pd prettier
in the course of development by using a nicer gui toolkit. Sliders and
toggles were only added in Pd 0.35 or maybe 0.34. Personally I don't
care much about the looks, there are other things that should be fixed
before that. But still Pd has found a lot of users who like the
flexibility and extensibility Pd gives them. And who like the better
stability compared to Max on OS9.

Ok to be honest I'm not gonna switch distros...... but are you saying 
that Redhat offers you extra software that allows you to change the IRQs 
that your pci cards are on?






-->><<--__-->><<--



There is no such software on any distro. Your motherboard's BIOS decides 
which PCI slots get which IRQs. In a few motherboards the BIOS lets one 
select which IRQs get assigned to certain slots, but most don't. So with 
most motherboards all one can do is move cards around to different slots 
and then see what IRQ gets assigned. If your sound card and your 
ethernet card are sharing an IRQ, that's because those PCI slots used 
both have the same IRQ assignment. If you swap just those two cards 
slot-for-slot they will end up with the same IRQ again. Try moving just 
one of the cards to another slot. If all of your slots are full then 
move multiple cards.

On some motherboards with some processors you can turn on Local APIC 
support in your kernel config and get more IRQs to work with. Dual 
processor motherboards, even if they have only one CPU installed, can do 
this to get more IRQs. If you have dual CPUs you should already be 
running a SMP kernel and you probably don't have IRQ assignment 
problems. If you do, it's back to juggling cards.

Hi,

I'm pretty sure I've read that APIC is a no no and should be avoided. 

Here's a link to some interesting info about "normal" IRQs in a PC. There is 
more to it than just having an "OWN" IRQ, they have different priorities.

-->><<--__-->><<--

I can vouch for this. My BIOS allows me to set IRQs for PCI slots. Having 
read the information linked to, I set up my soundcard to sit on IRQ 9. My 
BIOS was originally set to APIC, so at that stage, I left it.

Linux didn't have a problem, and left the card where it was, but when I 
used Windows, things were totally stuffed. Windows had the hide to move the 
card to an APIC IRQ of 22, giving bad latency, and clicks and pops, with 
both ASIO and kernel streaming.

Unfortunately, Windows doesn't allow one to simply change the BIOS setting 
to PIC. You have to re-install Windows for it to use that. Even then 
Windows decided to share the IRQ with something else.

Interesting enough, even with APIC support compiled into the kernel, Linux 
did no such thing with the IRQs.

I would personally suggest avoiding ACPI as well. IMO it is very much a 
waste of resources.

I'd like to see what you read.  In my experience it either works or it 
doesn't.  One can't avoid using APIC interrupts in a dual-processor 
system. 


Yes, that HOWTO has good info, as far as it goes.  One thing I would add 
though, is that when using non-APIC interrupts the interrupt priority is 
not fixed in stone (or silicon, as it were).  Using the program 
"irqtune" one can change interrupt priorities (see 
http://www.best.com/~cae/irqtune ).  I havn't used irqtune in a while, 
not since kernel 2.2 days, so I'm not altogether sure that it works 
correctly with 2.4.x kernels.  On Debian it is in the "hwtools" 
package.  Hmm, I just tried it on a box with a 2.4.21+lowlatency kernel 
and it seems that it worked, though it gave some warnings.  I can't 
really test if the IRQ priorities have changed though.   YMMV.

You are running 2.6.0-test5 on your studio machine? These results mean 
nothing if you are running a 2.4.x kernel.

wes




-->><<--__-->><<--

and it wont in general because the timing is wrong - too fast i guess.



ah. ok.

sounds like you want what i would call a midi librarian. I like the realtime
recording method for quickly saving a few sounds to reconstitute a
session without adding extra files, but is not good for maintaining a 
library :-)

the other methods mentioned by yourself and Rick sound good.

To be quite honest, unless you have a technical background you probably won't ever get very involved in Linux as an OS of choice for media production. I was a computer science major before I changed to a digital media major, so I have somewhat of a background to fall back on when using Linux. (Not enough of a background to contribute as a developer, but enough to at least understand what is going on... at least _most of the time_)

Even though Linux has made great strides in becoming an end-user OS for server and office use lately, it is still a hobby OS as far as audio, video, graphics etc are concerned. You're not going to have much success convincing people to use it for media purposes unless they are eager to get their hands dirty. Many of the DM students argue constantly over Win vs. Mac and when I tell them I use Linux I just get this really weird look. (At least from the ones who even know what Linux is.) I would never convince any of them to try Linux and I'm not going to try. It has to be something you're already interested in.

BTW: I would personally recommend giving Gentoo a try. It takes some work, but the end result is a system that is _much_ more responsive when doing audio work. Even when compared with something like planet-ccrma. Plus the Gentoo community is amazing.

It is true that lots of the major pipelines, especially ones heavily into CGI work, are turning to Linux systems. However, most or them are the huge industry powerhouses (Pixar, Dreamworks etc) who have their own in house software and developement. They are just simply porting their software over to Linux. So even though they are proving that Linux works as an excellent OS for media production, very little of the apps they use are available to the public. And of course they are willing to get their hands dirty... :o)

I've managed to do it succesfully with /dev/sequencer and I'm using ALSA.

cat sysex.txt > /dev/sequencer

and my Korg 03R/W receives them happily. Of course the file must be
carefully hand crafted, with hexedit or similar. And remember the
manufacturer ID, if it doesn't match your synth, it discards the sysex
string.

The timing shouldn't be an issue unless you want to send sysexes at
specific time, eg. when synth is playing and you want to tweak the
parameters realtime.

SGI,used to have a certain degree of usage in 3D special effects but not 
so much nowadays. IfSGI do much in post production it tends to be with 
high end film compositing tools from Discreet Logic, which certainly 
handle audio but very much as second fiddle to their streaming video 
handling.
Certainly audio research was done with SGI kit, Sox et al, but certainly 
in London the majority of audio work is done with Apple kit.

I think Linux may well be more usable (by non-Linux-advocates) 
for certain kinds of film work than it is for audio work 
presently, due in large part to the availability of things like 
Maya.  I don't think any equivalent sea change has happened on 
the audio side, though Ardour and the like could well get there 
soon.  

Something like a Protools port (don't mean to get that thread 
started again) would be equivalent to the Maya situation: it 
would get Linux the foot in the door it needs to be used in more 
mainstream studios.  The type of guys who went to Cool Edit Pro 
instead of buying Apple kit will eventually try Linux for 
similar reasons.  Meanwhile, it's Apple's game to lose.

Hallo,


The absolutely best audio player for Windows IMO is foobar2000(.org)
It's open source, it supports ogg, flac, mp3 and all else and is
really cool to look at... ;)

One of the many neat features it has is global shortcuts. I use this a
lot at work to transcribe radio interviews. It allows you to control
for example Rewind or the Pause function with a global key (I use
NUMPAD-0). That way you don't need to leave focus of the text editor
application to stop and rewind a missed section. This is sooo cool and
a major time saver. If someone could add this feature to alsaplayer it
would be wonderful... 

I think, Foobar2000 should be the only player allowed on a Linux
user's Windows desktop, period.

Hi,


I may be barking up the wrong tree about APIC, there are other acronyms that 
may be at work here ;)....

But, to conclude, I think the source of my argument is probably here on the 
list. If memory serves me it was Mark Knecht (who also had written the text 
on the page below) that had commented about it earlier...

The reasoning (i think) was that IRQ priority and IRQ sharing are the two 
important things to look out for. With APIC you get enough IRQ's, but you 
don't know which priority they have to each other which is fatal.


Cool! I didn't know it was possible to device such a program. Have to check it 
out!

Frank,
   Thanks for the pointer.

   OK, I've uninstalled winamp (for now) and am trying out foobar2000. It's
pretty minimalistic, but it's working. Impossible to say if it sounds any
good on this system which uses a SB Audigy and a noisy external amp and
speakers. I'm listening with some headphones. This amp has a lot of hiss. It
does work though, which is always the first step. I'll try it for a few days
and see how it goes.

Thanks,
Mark

what a cool idea!

wouldnt this be a windowmanager specific thing?
what wm are you using? i guess any decent wm should
be able to assign an arbitrary keyboard command to
a program. i already have a program which acts as an intermediary
between apache and alsaplayer so if i can work out
how to do this in the ion wm i'll give it a shot!

how many seconds for the rewind, 10?

Hi. I need to do basic editing to a 8-channel drum track. What I'm looking
for is a program that would remember what I've done, so that I can repeat
the same actions to another file. So, instead of editing the 8 tracks
simultaneously, I would edit just one track and then perform the same
operations to the rest 7 tracks.

Any ideas?

I think ardour might have a chance of sneaking us into the
audio industry through the back door of the aforementioned
film industry :-)  For anyone who's not on ardour-dev: Paul D.
has some work that should be done by ardour 1.0 that enables it
to support synchronized playback of animatics, and building on that,
video playback in the future. (I'm not clear on whether this is
handled by a special kind of track within ardour, or a separate
jack client.) That might be interesting to production
companies: they can twiddle the source to fit their needs, avoid
some number of expensive licenses, etc. just as they've done with
linux.

And, I can't seem to remember... Wasn't one of the good editors
partly funded at some point by a film studio? Did I just make that up?
Audacity? Sweep? Rezound? Anybody? Bueller? Bueller?

Hallo,



Ah, yes, the WM should be able to do that. I never thought of that.
I'm using blackbox which can run any program on any key. So a remote
controlled alsaplayer should be rather easy using libalsaplayer. I'll
have to dig deeper into this.


I think, I normally do use 10 seconds rewind to get into the speech

Hi,


Yes, and the question is a highly pertinent one if you think about it for a 
moment. I manage a music website - using Linux entirely nowadays - I'd dearly 
love to scrap all the .mp3 files in favour of .oggs but it occurs to me that 
this would mean /most/ of my readers won't listen to the music - it's fairly 
unlikely that I'm going to be able to persuade the majority of them to 
download /anything/ regardless of how easy any of us think it is to do.

I recently had some problems with static while playing back some wav files with Winamp3 on my W98 partition, and after reading this thread, tried Winamp2.91 (I think, 2.9x anyway).  It seems to be working alright so far, thoough I haven't tested it with the problem files yet.

What's wrong with Winamp3?  Is it the same kind of static problems that I encountered, or something else?

Oh, and BTW, Winamp2.x for the last couple of releases supports Ogg Vorbis without needing a plug-in.

Tim,
   I completely agree. I've been a Windows user for what, 15 years now?. I
have 5 PCs at home. I've dealt with enough buggy Windows audio software over
the years, so I download and install almost nothing unless I have some form
of assurance from people I trust that it's good stuff that won't mess my
system up. Even with that experience today is the first time I've listened
to an .ogg on any Windows PC.

   Granted, I'm a careful guy, but I think from your perspective it's way
more difficult. I've known for a long time what an .ogg is, but when you
come across one Windows Media Player doesn't tell the casual user anything
about making it work. It just says it won't play it. You can attempt to put
instructions on-line, but careful people like me probably won't use them
unless there's something important about what we want to listen to. Worse is
that something goes wrong and people blame you. That's really bad for
business I'm sure.

   And on the other hand, Linux based musicians who *want* their music to be
heard are cutting their nose off not making it extremely available through
mp3s. Frankly, independent of the perceived advantages of .ogg over mp3
(open source, sounds better, no licensing issues or royalty payments) it's
just good business to make your product usable by more people. That leads to
good stuff. Forcing people to go to .ogg seems like it's backwards to the
open source movement.

The other perspective is that if you can't hack the pace then you 
shouldn't be in the drivers seat.

Linux is designed for hackers by hackers and anyone who wants to get in

If everyone who went to the races was a driver we would have no 
audience, so I don't mind being the odd one out because it means I make

There's a certain amount of notoriety earned when people see what I make

 Most of the apps are available in the stock distribution. It's not quite as
stable as stable but you get the added advantages of Gnome2 {which, alone, is
worth the upgrade}, a whole new set of apps in your dselect window and much more
media stuff. If everything's working well it makes sense to upgrade.

 As far as breaking the Demudi stuff goes... I really don't know. Most of the
software that interests me is available through standard channels. Low latency
and rt patches {as well as some other nifty stuff} download the same way.

Hallo,


I disagree. I see a necessity in trying to force people to use ogg or
any other free (as speech) codec, before "digital rights protected"
codecs get more widely used. It's politics, but I think it important.
Mp3 is not an alternative here, because there already are more
powerful commercial and DRM enabled codecs available and it is an
important task to not let these take over.

OK, I forgot about lspnp/setpnp and lspci/setpci. I use lspnp/setpnp on 
my IBM Thinkpad 600E to turn the external serial port on and off, among 
other things. lspnp/setpnp require a kernel with PNP support compiled 
in. Kernel 2.4 mainline doesn't have this yet, but it is in the -ac 
patches and also in the kernel that some distros have (Redhat has it I 
think, but Debian doesn't). 2.6 has PNP support.

The support for using lspci/setpci is in all 2.4.x kernels I think, but 
it doesn't always do what you want. I have a Zoran 36057 video capture 
device sitting on IRQ 10, same as my sound card. IRQ 9 is unused (no 
ACPI), so I just tried "setpci -v -s 03:09.0 INTERRUPT_LINE=09" to 
change its IRQ. lspci -v still says it is at IRQ 10, but lspci -b -v 
says it is at IRQ 9. Which is it? OK, I modprobe zr36067 and the module 
loads, and now both lspci -v and lspci -v -b agree that the Zoran chip 
is at IRQ 10, so nothing changed. *Sigh* I suppose setpci will work in 
some cases, with some cards, but it sure isn't a panacea.

I back you on this Frank. It's roughly equivalent to gpl'ing code. At 
least from a philosophical perspective if not legal. Anyone who tries to 
pass off an open source ogg release as their own music is just lame but 
they should be encouraged to sample it and rework it to their hearts 
content. I just wish flac was more widely accepted but that ain't gonna 
happen.

Imagine if all cdplayers understood flac instead of cdda...

Frank,
   I acknowledge your right to have this opinion, but it isn't going to
change the basic fact that if a Windows user doesn't know how to listen
to your ogg, he isn't going to hear it. 

   I think the real job to be done is to make ogg a standard that's
accepted by M$ one fo these days and just included in their Media Player
releases, so the user doesn't have to figure this stuff out. As I said,
I went 15 years without bothering until today. (Of course, I am a bit
slow!) ;-)

Mark

Patrick,
   I didn't understand your point. I didn't think we were talking about
passing other people's music off as our own. I thought we were saying
that Windows users cannot listen to ogg files without making adjustments
to their systems. 

   I guess I just didn't follow your point.

Cheers,
Mark

open formats are complete anathema to microsoft. They will
*never* *ever* support ogg until the US government does its job
properly.


with wma becoming the standard for commercial releases, its very

be able to do the same...

yeah I guess you're right.  a stand alone librarian would be just the
trick - if they seemed to exist! :)  it sort of seemed to me that it was now
an easier or more likely thing that you'd see a bit of a sysex librarian
inside a sequencer package than as a standalone, but now that I think about
it, nah.

I hadn't thought of it as bloated per se *laugh*  it's a simple feature
that's a part of cakewalk for DOS, for god's sake - they all seem to do
realtime sysex recording/playback - seems a lot easier to do normal dumping
to me, since that was happening before realtime sysex stuff (or WAS it?)
but it used to be that they hadn't integrated sysex stuff into sequencers,
so you'd get these little midi librarian programs.  well ok then cakewalk
and others integrated the little midi librarian into the sequencer.  hence,
my thought...

never fear, i'm not done searching.  midi mountain might do it.  jazz++
might do it (anybody know?) but, alas, I have yet to get either of these
little critters to compile.  jazz has all kinds of damn dependancies!  it
wants wxwin 168e which i haven't been able to find.  midi mountain just sort
of - won't.  there's a libarian of sorts called glib - haven't managed to
get it compiled either (a weird problem I may be on here asking about ;) -
on and on! :)


ahh yes.  I THINK you may be right, but i'm not sure.  i did find this
package, downloaded it, and it requires a java runtime enviroment, and i
have yet to try getting that installed, being that it got late and i turned
off the studio and came home to watch brainless movies :)  but it may be the
ticket, if I can suceed with getting java installed :)


thanks!


ps:
a weird thing happened in the middle of this:

cat filename.syx >/dev/midi00  WORKED - once.  and never again.  and the
synth was a little disconcerted by the dumpfile, but that is probably the
quirkyness of that particular synth.  then the cat command stopped working.
it would send out and I could see midi lights lighting up and the synth took
the data that one time - it was like a 2 minute window of that command doing
the job and then boof the window closed, the universe turned its back,
Krishna was lonely again and it worked no more! *laugh*  go figure that one.




-->><<--__-->><<--

Yes, sadly quite true...


Yes...


Sure. No problem. However, don't necessarily think everyone wants to be

Why not run Cakewalk for DOS under either Wine or DOSEMU in Linux?

Would that work? (Question to the group as well as Aaron)

Does Rosegarden not do SysEx dumps? I'm surprised.

- Mark (doing Reaktor bass lines tonight...)




-->><<--__-->><<--

Hi Aaron, hi Tim:

  IIRC Cakewalk was one of the first sequencers to let you try adding 
sysex messages to the sequence stream. At that time that meant adding 
only very short messages, because the hardware was so slow. A sysex 
message of any length would audibly disturb the sequence timing. But I 
thought that feature was pretty advanced, it would let the user make 
neat little adjustments to his synths that were beyond the reach of MIDI 
controllers. Alas, I never really got into Cakewalk, I was (and still 
am) too happy with Voyetra's Sequencer Plus. The Voyetra programmers 
wouldn't add the feature precisely because of the timing issue.

  With CPU speeds being what they are today I'd expect in-stream sysex 
would be a given for Rosegarden and MusE. Werner ? Chris ? Richard ?

  Sequencer Plus Gold included a nifty patch librarian that supported 
quite a variety of machines. I'd love to see something like that in RG 
or MusE too. Maybe in the future ?

Skip glib. The pyramids of Giza are younger...

[re: JSynthLib]

JS will work for you if it supports your synths. I worked with Torsten 
on the TX802 stuff, frankly I think he did a terrific job. In Linux MIDI 
software JS is the closest thing to my old Bacchus and Sideman editors, 
or to the graphic editors for the Mac and other 68k machines. But JS 
could certainly use some more developers... :(

Cranky me would love to see a MIDI-only sequencer for Linux, i.e., with 
absolutely no audio support. But I'm not too distressed: I can run 
Sequencer Plus in DOSemu just fine, and I've recently been playing with 
Master Tracks Pro in Xsteem (an Atari ST emulator), with pretty good 
results too...

Btw, out of all the links on the MIDI page of the Linux soundapps site 
here's the Linux MIDI software I actually use :

  MusE
  KeyKit
  JSynthLib

I've recently installed PlanetCCRMA's RH9 and will soon get into 
Rosegarden too. There are some other interesting links I want to check 
out, I just have to figure how to do  without sleep and food...

actually, I forgot to mention, yes one of the things I did today was get
dosemu (which is really cool) - so far, cakewalk doesn't quite run.  two
things are wrong - one is that it is all crooked and screwy on the screen
and doesn't quite respond to menu navigation right either (although even if
it did, you can't see anything) - the other is the midi interface driver.
cakewalk uses a native driver, of which there aren't any for newer
interfaces (like my midisport 2x2) - it has a regular mpu401 driver which I
figured might work with the HDSP 9652 midi portion, but that hasn't worked -
yet.

this is actually something I may need help with.  it's VERY confusing to me
(not that I understood it THAT well to begin with) how to address the midi
card under emudos.  I barely BARELY have an understanding of it under
linux - that it seems to be called midi00 and can be referred to that way.
but in cakewalk, you set it up by using it's base address and irq number ? -
so I'm all confused as to how to figure out how to get to either the HDSP
midi portion or the midisport (since the midisport is usb) - cards like the
HDSP and usb midi interfaces didn't exist in the days of the now defunct
cakewalk for DOS.

so tommorrow, what I'm gonna try is doing it the way I used to with my
laptop (before it died) - and that is to use the serial port connected to my
Yamaha TG100, using the TG100 as the MIDI interface, because there is a
cakewalk driver for that, and that's what I always used.

that won't solve the crazy screen problem though.  I thought I might drop to
run level three and see if I can run dosemu there.  that won't be a total
solution, though, because eventually I'll want to sync cakewalk to other
apps (which actually should be easy - my theory is that I'll send MTC out of
the HDSP MIDI or midisport, and to the TG100, and since that's out of the
box, it'll be just as if I was still running cakewalk on my laptop.  god if
only my laptop wasn't dead! :)  THIS is one good reason to try out the
fluxbox instructions you sent me off list :)  I figure MAYBE fluxbox will
handle running cakewalk for DOS better.

that enough typing for ya?


I can't figure out how.  it does deal with sysex in some form.  the key here
is that I have a bunch of files - suchandsuch.SYX -   which may not work,
for all I know - like I said, I did manage to get one to load using cat, but
the synth wouldn't receive midi when the new patches were selected - I don't
know why.  this won't be a moot exercise though, as sysex dumping back and
forth is a key element in my room.  it's a key element in general, which is
why I'm surpised I'm having such a hard time finding librarians.




-->><<--__-->><<--

I don't remember which windows app it was, but back in my dark 
days of doing everything with MIDI synths, I used to be able to 
have the sequencer send a sysex file containing the appropriate 
patches for the song to each synth (I had/have a Korg M1 and 
Yamaha DX7.)  It seems to me that an even older piece of 
software let me do that as well, maybe an Amiga or DOS based 
sequencer.  

Of course those boards both predate General MIDI, so you had no 
way to expect patch 0 to be a grand piano, etc.  I'd expect the 
need for something like that to be rather less nowadays 
(certainly I do nearly everything with software synths and I 
can't conceive of a way to set them all up automatically at the 
beginning of a song without using a fairly rigid framework like 
Buzz on the PC where you do all your sound generation internally 
or using plugins, nothing like ALSA or Jack), but there was a 
time when it was very necessary.  Necessary as in "Oh my god, I 
have 700 banks on this floppy, which one was I using when I 
wrote this song?!"

I think they can do a sysex stream during playback (don't quote me on that).
which is weird to me.  it seems like it a sysex librarian that's not
operating during playback and is just used to do non-realtime dumps would be
easier to deal with, both for the developers and for the hardware.  but from
what I can figure out, Rosegarden and muse and most of them don't have that
feature, but DO have realtime sysex streaming - *shrug*


that would be great.  there was something REALLY fantastic about the
cakewalk sysex librarian.  it didn't NEED to support your machine.  there
were several hundred scripts for querying certain machines (and you could
write your own), but none of my machines were supported.  didn't matter.
you just pick "wait for manual dump" and dump from your machine.  when you
dumped back, it didn't matter, you just tell cakewalk "dump" and if the syx
file was formatted for the machine, the machine would respond.


*laugh*  so it seemed!


it has support for the Alesis QS series - do you know if this equates to the
S4/quadrasynths?  i can't quite remember.  again, ideally it wouldn't matter
unless you were editing patches, which I may or may not do - right now I
just want to dump preformed .syx files


I might have to try sequencer plus just for fun.  maybe it'll run better
than cakewalk (cakewalk goes kind of haywire right now).  yes I do would
love to see sequencers without audio.  I'm never gonna put friggin audio in
a sequence, that's what multitrackers and samplers are for.  to me, sync the
sequencer to tape (or "tape", as it were) is the way, baby! :)






-->><<--__-->><<--

You were also suggesting that if we don't provide music in mp3 format we 
are missing out on a huge market.

ogg format comes with less political bs than any of the other major file 
formats and if a user can't figure out how to listen to one that's just 
too bad. If you've only got blue chips and the slot machines want red 
chips you either don't play or you go and get red chips right?

I wouldn't buy an mp3 anyway and wouldn't sell any music that wasn't at 
least cd quality, so providing mp3's is not a high priority for me.

One of the ways that Linux audio will appeal to people is by retaining a 
certain amount of exclusivity. That's what makes it cool. If we end up 
with millions of people all playing the same cheesey noises with Linux 
apps then we've lost IMO.

Well, if he needs this functionality in a sequencer, then maybe he needs to 
send sys-ex in real-time, in which it would be mighty convenient to have it 
in the sequencer. But then of course you need replacable parameters, etc.

Or even if it's just downloading in bulk before the sequence starts, I can't 
see why you _wouldn't_ want this capability in the sequencer.  Why make more 
work for the user?

this is a classic marketing mistake (not that we're in the game of marketing
on this list) - experience I've had is, unless you're Michael Jackson or
Eminem, if they've got blue chips and you only take red chips, they go home,
you starve, next time, you come accepting blue, you eat.  as a person, I
love .ogg - as a business man, it's not even worth my time.  I'll probably
share songs with people i meet in this community using .ogg - on the
website, it'll be mp3s (or both - both is always a good thing)


yep.  me too.  another experience of mine is, mp3s don't sell.  it's like
selling dub tapes.  dub tapes are what the consumer makes off of your high
quality CD and passes around.  they ain't gonna pay for 'em.  when they're
ready to buy, they'll buy a CD.  mp3s are for promotion, period.  which is
it that's crumbling now, emusic.com?  starting to raise their fees and stop
allowing unlimited downloads.  every site on the internet that paid
musicians through charging for downloads has implemented charging musicians
for the service.  napster is reopening on a charge basis.  see how long that
shit lasts.

eh.  2cents.  anybody wanna buy a CD?

Not from external files, no.  It's on the todo list.  RG does

although there's no particularly useful way to edit them.

The interrupt_line register doesn't affect the card in any way, it's
there for information purposes only. The BIOS sets this register so
that drivers know which interrupt to use.

To change the interrupt routing, you have to reprogram some registers
of the PCI controller (starting at 60h in Intel's ICHx southbridges
IIRC, but read Intel's datasheet first). And I don't know if the
kernel is able to realize that the interrupt has changed.

dyne:bolic was built from scratch, rather than based on an existing 
distro, so it's quite possible you are the first to discover this 
bug. Personally, I've had no trouble booting it, but it won't detect 
ISA hardware on one of the old machines I've got here. I don't think 
that's a major problem in a multimedia distro, since ISA hardware is 
unlikely to be up to the job anyway.

Having said that, I do own an ISA-based Turtle Beach Tropez Plus card 
which has a good hardware sampler and wavetable synth on it. If 
anyone is interested in hacking on the ALSA driver for this vintage 
equipment, please let me know and I will gladly post it to you.

Sure - what we do is provide .ogg as standard and .mp3 as the inferior 
alternative, legacy format. That begs the question 'what's better 
about Ogg?' to which the answer is 'faster download and less storage 
space for you, less bandwidth used for me'. Saving bandwith will be 
appreciated by people hosting music sites.

I figure arguments about sound quality are lost on people who listen 
to music on iPods or those little plastic speakers that you get free 
with the computer. The same would go for discussion on patents for 
people who use Windows; they are not really interested. But faster 
downloads due to smaller file size - everyone can appreciate that.

recently, i have gotting into creating (S)VCD's quite a bit. it is rather
easy to burn something that works, though it becomes rather more difficult
once you start tweaking the command line parameters (lots!), and it involves
several applications in a row (pipes, and temp files). i have been using the
dvgrab (i've been encoder miniDV recording), mjpegtools (lav2yuv, yuvdenoise,
yuvscaler, mpeg2enc, etc), mplex, and vcdimager. capabilities of standalone
players do vary quite a bit, so you can decide to create (S)VCD's that follow
the standard to play safe, or try higher bitrates. www.dvdrhelp.com has a
rather extensive list of user-reports on player capabilities.

Tim,

sorry I didn't mean to scare you. Many things are changed from woody to 
sarge.. I'm using woody plus a number of additional packages compiled 
from sources (i.e. audio, kde), since some sid packages would even break 
libc compatibility... so you might ask the debian guys at irc.debian.org 
what the situation with woody->sarge is.
hope this helps

If you are familiar with tracker-style interface, then I suggest you check
shaketracker & tutka.

http://www.reduz.com.ar/cheesetronic/ -> shaketracker

http://www.nongnu.org/tutka/

A new version of Tutka has been just released, I haven't tested it yet,
but the old version had sysex in/out, but it lacked the sysex editor - so
you were only able to send sysexes that you first received from your
synth.

I discussed with the developer (back in year 2002) about a sysex editor,
don't know if it's implemented yet.

Since the sid packages look to be very old (judging by the ftp server 
timestamps) I would expect everything they were depending on to be in Sarge 
by now. Can't say for sure though.

Does anyone know much about demudi/Agnula? It looks pretty moribund judging by 
the website. I think an audio-centric distro would be a great thing, but I'm 
not sure if this one's going anywhere.

[....] IT's true that there is a lot of Linus use in the CG companies in

50/50 and a lot of those linux boxes are in render farm (the mill for
instance has a very heavy linux pipeline, but most of the desktops
stations are 2k I believe)

to whoever said this...

Whilst *many& of the magor CG apps run on Linux, *many* of them don't.
*all* of them run on 2K. So whilst a lot of people would prefer to use
it, that doesn't mean that they can.

Well, the company I work for currently runs all 3D (maya and renderman) and 2D

renderfarm (another couple of hundred dedicated machines). 
There are a few people with additonal NT boxes really only for running
photoshop. A few macs here and there, but not many. The main reason for the
heavy linux use is that the majority of the pipeline tools are written in
shellscript, and the whole culture is very unix - and of course it can cope
with being put under a lot more stress than the competition when throwing
around huge amounts of data.

This means that for most people here, linux is the main desktop OS, for email,

that isnt what he was asking about, but i agree, the ability
to be able to edit parameters either graphically or in a list
is pretty essential.
 
i just think librarian features should be kept separate.


yes its a nice feature, but Linux doesnt have enough developers to
support everything one might like. I'm anti 'bloated monoliths' for
many reasons:
1-developer time is a precious resource.
  Rosegarden Chris has already been distracted by this thread
  when he possibly has more useful things to do.
2-development of linux audio is current done in v small teams.
  I dont see this as a disadvantage as long as it is recognised
  and strategy planned accordingly.
3-advanced features are useless if the app segfaults at the drop of
  a hat. This is best acheived by them being small.
4-personally i dont beleive that large apps are good for the user.
  it makes them lazy. Very high quality low level tools exist already
  and i think it makes sense to use them. Eg i will always use a text
  editor to complete a job if possible. Similarly i will always
  use a filemanager or bash for file operations, possibly with drag n
  drop, rather than some half baked dialogue box. Its more flexible,
  encourages skills development, has a longer lifespan, and may even
  be faster in the shortterm.
5-others :-)

"...for water in its natural course runs away from high places and hastens

relation to the foe whom he is facing. Therefore, just as water retains
no constant shape, so in warfare there are no constant conditions. He
who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby
succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-born captain."

i kind of agree, but filesize is not a unique advantage of ogg.
The marketing guy will come along and say 'use wma then'.
There are reputedly marginally better codecs than ogg (aac?),
but ogg has one single unique advantage: Freedom. I'm not
convinced that promoting it on any other grounds will be successful
in the long term.

I don't think I was suggesting that at all, but I'm not clear as to who the
'we' is in your sentence above.

My point was that *if* an individual musician *wants* people to hear his
music, then *he/she* has choices to make. If *he/she* chooses to release
only in .ogg format, then *he/she* lives with the consequences of that
decision. That is *his/her* right.

In the original case, where Tim (I think) stated he'd like to dump mp3s from
his site, but he was worried that people would stop listening, he is simply
stating facts as he sees them and my point is supporting his contention.

I defend your right to choose any format you'd like. I have no problem with
that. Do you have a problem with me choosing mp3s and reaching more people
more easily? Maybe that's the contention here...


As a user, absolutely. As a business man who is paid based on how many
people play on my slot machine, I might want to buy a machine that will
accept both red and blue chips, right? I make more money. I think Tim may
provide both mp3 and oog, but he's saying that 99% of the people out there
listen to the mp3s.


I won't buy one either.


<ADD> certain, technical </ADD>


<ADD> for certain types of people. </ADD>


I think we are in totally different head spaces. If the next great cheesy
pop star comes from the Linux world to replace <you enter current cheesy pop
starts name here>, and the new cheesy pop star only has music in .ogg
format, will people EVER hear this new cheesy pop star so that *he/she* can
become big and dominate our media? I think not, but you are free to
disagree.

In my mind technology is about making like *easier* and *better* for people,
not more difficult. If, in someone else's mind, life is about making
political statements, then I defend their right to do that. However, few
make a difference in my life, but that's just me. I think you're in a
different place which is cool.

That's exactly what I'm trying to do. MS isn't going to include OGG in
their player unless users are aware that it's a feature worth having,
and that won't happen if they'd never heard of it. We have to start
somewhere. My site has both MP3 and Ogg files on it and I'm at pains to
(a) to explain what Ogg is and (b) to make it clear that it isn't a
linux-only format (yes, people do believe that)

Actually the isuue of DRM and that Ogg will never be affected by it
might be a good point to make in that context.

Hallo,


You're right, but this doesn't bother me for my music. I have a link
to foobar2000.org on my site for all my Windows friends. I hope I can
promote it this way. 

This is a whole other ballpark when it comes to "commercial" use. I
work for a public radio station's website and we support 3 formats for
live streams: RA, MP3 and WMA. WMA has by far the worst sound quality
but still is the most popular stream. 

We sometimes get mails by open source advocates like me who ask for an
ogg stream. But as streams cost a lot of money and as ogg players
aren't in widespread we don't plan to support ogg in the near future.
It would be too much effort for us without really getting more
listeners by this action. It's a pity, but that's the way it is. 

To me this is one more reason to advocate ogg where I can. 


I don't think this will happen, but mp3 wasn't supported in earlier
Windows OSes almost everone has some kind of Winamp installed now. I'd
like that to happen with Ogg somehow, too. Winamp coming with ogg
plugin is a good chance.

The biggest internet music demographic, be it legal or not, is adolescent
kids in suburbia. As an adolescent kid in suburbia with 3 adolescent
siblings, I can tell you with confidence from experience in my house and
with friends that .mp3  is the king of internet music formats by at least
an order of magnitude.

People in my realm get internet music from three types of locations, in
descending order of frequency:

1) P2P (mainly KaZaA)
2) mp3.com et al
3) Ripped CDs

In all cases, mp3 is the lingua franca, the de facto standard. Formats
such as wma and ra are considered laughable, they sound so much worse
until the file size reaches gargantuan proportions. The only people using
such formats are 'Tools of the Man', so to speak, and as you can see from
the above list, none of the real music listeners give two craps about
them.  Posting in ogg isn't that big a deal, winamp can play them and I'm
pretty sure the internal player in KaZaA can also. These kids aren't as
hesitant as most grownups either, if you tell them that "you need to
download and run X to use superior format Y" they'll do it.

The problem, as I see it, is distribution.  To take advantage of the big
daddy, P2P, people gotta know who you are and want your stuff in advance.
You can try using misleading filenames or info tags so that your stuff
gets accidentaly downloaded, but I personally just delete stuff like
that, so I wouldn't recommed it. You have a better chance of getting
heard by option 2, the music websites, if someone is doing genre
browsing, but then you're going to have to use mp3.  As for CD ripping...
well, if that even becomes an option then we've already won IMHO.

In my perfect world, everyone would use ogg or flac or some other equally
libre format.  In order to help realize that goal, we need to gain
musical clout so that the kids look up to us, and then choose to
distribute solely in formats that we endorse.  We gotta have that clout
first, however, and we aren't gonna get that without compromising.  A
good solution, in my pea brain, is to setup an account with something
like mp3.com and post a few _good_ songs (the songs have to be _good_ or
else we're dead in the water).  If you get the kid's attention, they'll
check out your personal artist page, from which you can link to your
homepage where they can get "even more and newer" music in the "vastly
superior and unrestrained" ogg format. The songwriting is going to be the
biggest factor, IMHO.  Without kickin' tunes, nothing else matters.
Period.  Get good songs, get them distributed, get popularity, get power,
establish ogg as the new lingua franca for the hip and rebellious music
community.

Peace,
=Pete

There is the matter of the radio station or whatever keeping its 
options open so it doesn't get screwed by the vendor. I'm sure Virgin 
Radio has figured this one out. 

Surely the cost of streams is in proportion to the number of users, if 
the software is free beer?

As for .wma being the most popular, that's probably due to tight OS 
integration and the fact that so many users just have what came with 
the machine when they bought it. It's up to broadcasters to recommend 
better quality and performance formats if they want competitive 
advantage.

Isn't this just because it's what Windows Media Player tries to get first,
if the user doesn't ask for anything specific? It's coming out of the GUI
pages in Media Player directly. Users see what looks like a web page
(probably is a web page for all I know) and those web pages, programmed by
M$, are asking for WMA, so that's what most people get.

I think an underlying aspect of this whole conversation is that users do not
know what they are getting, and they frankly really don't care what they are
getting. They just get it in a mindless way, like TV. It ain't perfect, but
it works.

(BTW - Cheers to you for helping support Public Radio in any way, shape or
form. Can you help me figure out why KQED.org will no longer stream audio to
my windows desktop?) Did M$ figure out I use my XP machine to support the
Linux world and decide to cause me problems?) ;-)


Yep, possibly.

Hello - maybe someone can help

I have this problem - all of a sudden when I boot up, my HDSP9652 sound module 
won't load - a big red FAILED is shown - it was working yesterday - here's 
what I've got (some of you already know this ;) ), and what I changed:

Red Hat 9
planet ccrma install
Alsa drivers that me and mark K and fernando fixed with the HDSP patch by 
thomas
 - all was well

then I got the failed today, and when I tried to insmod the module from a 
terminal I get:
# /sbin/insmod snd-hdsp
Using /lib/modules/2.4.20-20.1.caps.rh90/kernel/sound/snd-hdsp.o
/lib/modules/2.4.20-20.1.caps.rh90/kernel/sound/snd-hdsp.o: unresolved symbol 
snd_hwdep_new_Rf0dea83e

hmm lesseee if I can remember what I changed yesterday (I don' t THINK I had 
tried rebooting anytime yesterday)

dosemu with cakewalk, and mdf (a simple does midi librarian) - I doubt this is 
the problem

the hotplug scripts from planet by doing:
apt-get install hotplug hotplug-gtk

that was in order to install midisport 2x2 driver from usb-midi-fw.sf.net

these last two are my culprits, I assume.  but everything was working nicely 
together yesterday, before I powered down.

I'm confused :)

I forgot to mention the other things I at least attempted to add to the 
system:

jsynthlib - added all but java - so far so good - didn't think this would be a 
conflict
glib - didn't add - it never would compile
midi mountain - it never would compile
jazz++ - got through step one on its list, which is to install lesstif-0.88.1, 
which I did using an rpm

that's all I can think of

Hey there HDSP buddy,

   I mentioned the other day (somewhere on some list) that there were a few
things I wanted Thomas to look at, but I didn't want to ask before he got
the big patch he was working on into CVS. Do you remember me saying that?;-)
You just found one of them.

   I get this periodically. I just reboot my box, sometimes warm, and
sometimes cold, and it comes back. The worst I've seen is two boots.

   I have no idea why it happens, but it has on my machine.

   Also, don't be too worried if one of these days you have booted the
machine, and maybe you've used audio for a while, and then machine sits for
a few hours, and then you come back to find out you cannot start hdspmixer.
You Alt-Ctrl-F1 into the console only to find a message about 'No HDSP cards
found'. This one is quite strange. It's like the modules get loaded, not
used, and deleted. I know Fernando has some instructions about turning off
auto-clean, which I thought I did, but possibly Gentoo is a bit different in
that respect.

   I wanted Thomas to look at that, presuming I didn't find a solution
first.

   Other things you might stumble on to include some problem with the spdif
input on the card getting disconnected only if hdspmixer is left open. I can
play my guitar for hours through that input if I first close hdspmixer, but
only for a minute or two with it open. However, if I change the spdif input
to professional or some other setting, the input comes back for another two
minutes... Weird 'eh? ;-)

   And then we have this weekend's testing job if you've followed Nick
Arnold's thread about his pseudo 96KHz problem where some bytes are out of
order. That would truly effect both you and I, if it turns out to be true.

   This driver works, but we ain't at 1.0 yet. ;-)

Cheers,
Mark

Don't use insmod, use modprobe instead. "snd-hdsp" depends on a module
that was not loaded and that's why it is failing with an unresolved
symbol message. Modprobe takes care of dependencies and loads anything
that the module needs. 

-- Fernando





-->><<--__-->><<--

Aaron,
   Actually, Fernando raises an interesting question. Is there any
possibility that you are running your older kernel and not your newest one?
I thought you were on a 2.4.21 or 22 type kernel? As you remember, the hdsp
driver and the kernel both have to be the right version or you'll get
unresolved symbol messages like this.

   Maybe you didn't update grub.conf correctly, or just boot a different
entry.

Mark





-->><<--__-->><<--

Yes, because in this specific case they are coming to a web page where the
user get choices. (BTW - yours streams just fine for me, so my problem with
KQED here in San Francisco must be a KQED problem and not a problem with my
machine.)

The case I was speaking of was when you open Windows Media Player and go to
the page called 'Media Guide'. On there, when ever I choose a link, it just
starts streaming, and as far as I can tell it's usually wma it's streaming.
I didn't get a chance to choose. M$ just said 'Give Mark wma data' and in it
comes.

If I tell Media Player to open your URL, it comes back telling me it
encountered a problem. If I was paranoid (I'm not) I would guess that M$
figured out you didn't have a wma data type and just refused to open it. ;-)

Thanks for the address though. Now I can work on my German!

Cheers,
Mark

	thanks to all who read that missive and responded, very 
interesting. lest you all think that i was complaining about the 
state of linux audio, i assure you i was not. i had interpreted 
earlier posts to be asking why more people weren't using linux audio 
tools, so i gave an example of somebody who had been working in 
another world and was moving into linux.
	i love the process of learning new things, gotta keep the old 
dog young, so for me learning more about how the hardware really 
interacts with the software is an interesting puzzle to work through 
--i feel the same way about writing code for supercollider. i don't 
come from a background of writing code so the process of learning how 
to do it is both frustrating and exciting --logic puzzles.

	though not necessary, i should clarify my statements about 
film and music industry media moving through macs, i meant mostly in 
terms of recording (audio), editing and mixing (both video and 
audio). certainly all the major visual-effect rendering has been cgi 
-moving to almost all linux now. (though my friends at pixar imply 
that there's some "upper management" pressure to sell renderman for 
mac g5s...but then they'd actually have to man the phones for tech 
support.. heh.)

	the one thing that i can't reconcile yet is mr shirkey's post 
about the other perspective: if you can't hack the pace then you 
shouldn't be in the driver's seat.
	i am definitely of two minds on this. one side says that, 
yes, no compromise should be made by those who know how to make a 
thing do what they want it to do simply to allow others do it as 
well. in this way there can be major forward momentum in the growth 
of a system, but it also makes an elite group of experts that must be 
deferred to in order to be able to use their wisdom. this can have 
deleterious effects upon the culture of the users, besides just 
making some cache of coolness that comes with being "in the know" 
(while appearing to be snobs from those that wish they could be in 
the know themselves!) that is completely irrelevant to the real 
situations, yet completely within human nature, wherein the 
development must take long and winding routes to reach the majority 
of the users who cannot "hack the pace", pun intended.
  	for myself, i see the allure of learning to stay on the 
bleeding edge of technology and to make music from software that is 
coming into being daily from a group of people who are likewise 
inclined. i am one of those people who has to take a preset apart to 
make something of their own before thinking that they are making 
their own music. and while i would love to believe i am special 
somehow for being that way, politically i think i am far too populist 
to allow it to become elitism. so that part of me wants to make the 
hard things get easier, perhaps.

ok, enough of this -

Jonathan,

	You work on code for supercollider?  Interesting.  A close friend of

I.  What, exactly, was your point?

-->><<--__-->><<--


Welcome to the *nix way :)


It's hard to tell if people are snobs or just ahead of the curve.


Things do get easier and also progressively more abstract. There are 
points where things that once seemed extremely difficult beocme daily 
chores and then you forget about trying to make a new gui for it because 
you found another way to do it and there are more pressing things that 
could be worked on.

However this approach is not going to sell Linux apps to the majority so 
  anyone who is in a frame of mind to make the niggly things work in a 
simple way should spend any free time they have on doing it.

Well spoken! I think this is not only related to ogg, it's related to most of 
the technology in the linux audio scene. We need to show people that it can 
actually be used to create great stuff. 

IMPO Linux audio isn't ready for the average Windows/Mac-user, but there is 
actually great stuff out there, and I bet you can use it to produce something 
that sounds great to listen to, without having to buy a lot of expensive 
hardware. But how do we catch people's interest? Right now, I'm not sure 
we're doing that (or perhaps I've been missing something. In that case, point 
me in a good direction). 

Personally, I went into linux audio with the intention to actually produce 
something that sounds equally good compared to stuff I've made with other, 
proprietary, apps, but I find myself getting more and more stuck into 
programming, not creating music ("I just need this little feature, then I'm 
satisfied, oh, and this little feature too... Gotta fix that... And why isn't 
this working?....."). Since I'm fond of both types of activities, I'm not 
complaining. I'm enjoying myself. A lot. But there's not a lot music 
produced. 

I think it would be worth lots to have a great showcase of things created with 
only free software. To actually have a bunch of living proof that shows what 
is actually possible to do, in the current state of linux audio software. 
High quality stuff (I guess one could argue a lot about what high quality 
stuff is, though). That speaks stronger to the "ordinary music lover" than a 
list of technical features of programs and file formats. I wish that all the 
audio apps would put up links to GOOD stuff actually produced using the apps. 
Not just "this is a sound created by a sine wave, a resonance filter and 
yaddayaddayadda" (even though I find such things cool, myself). Or perhaps 
(horrible thought), there isn't any such stuff? Are we actually only using 
the software to create "Absolute Sinus x" over and over again? Most of my 
audio friends seem to think that. I would love to prove them wrong. 

Is there such a showcase anywhere? I know there is good material out there 
made with Ardour, etc, but is it enough to make a showcase of? I bet there 
are a lot of warez-using hobbyist musicians that would love to switch, if 
they only believed there actually is a free alternative. Who wouldn't mind to 
get their hands a little dirty, if they only knew they could actually produce 
something that sounds ok in the end. The more ppl we get interested in these 
things, the better.

IMO this will never be a possiblity. The average user is more interested 
in the TV concept. In order for electronic music to progress these 
people are not going to be the heart of the scene.

They will however be the dancers and the listeners that make it 
worthwhile for us to produce music.

There is another school of thought which wants to use Linux apps for 
professional multimedia. Depending on whether you are the boss or the 
worker you may want to have extremely easy to use tools or you may want 
to have tools which are not so easy to use therefore ensuring job security.

I have to agree.  I have heard a few dozen tracks made with Linux software, and while they certainly possess artistic and technical merit, I didn't hear anything that I wanted to listen to a second time.  IMHO, until we produce at least a few examples of music which could be released by a major label, we simply will *not* be taken seriously.

The good news is that most of the tools are in place now, and I suspect that there are a lot of people (like me) who are motivated to create commercially viable art with Linux, but are in the process of discovering and exploring these tools right now.  I think a lot of new people are coming into the Linux audio community these days, some of them undoubtedly with extensive studio recording and music production backgrounds, and it is my hope that as they become familiar with the tools over the next year or so, we'll begin to see a proliferation of high-quality Linux-made recordings. :)

 I didn't realize these guys were actually serious... Last time I looked at
Darwin for pc it was a tiny little 2 meg package that just sort of sat on your
hard drive and beamed "I am Darwin for pc... you have better things to do" at
you... sort of like one of those bobbly-headed dogs that sits on the dashboard
in your grandma's Ford only with a Mac apple logo on it. I thought it was still
a tiny 2 meg package.

 They actually have a whole distribution put together... x86 install disks and
the whole bit. {Not that I've gotten it to install on anything yet.}

 Here my mind is aflame with new dangerous visions of toppling MS's world
domination overnight by by giving OSX to the pc masses, who thought they were
doomed to run win XPzillion forever, and all you can say is "their shuttle is

 Is there a difference? Does it really matter if you lie to your kernel?


 I think you need to re-read.

 If I look hard enough... I'm sure I can find something that will reach into
your bios and let you turn your whole machine inside out. Strangely enough... I
don't really see a point. The discussion concerned configuring ones machine to
see a particular "hardware suite" properly. Whether you change the actual
hardware or you change the way the software {like your bios} sees it you achieve
the same end.

How do you quantify this? If we are to take the recent discussions as a

linux audio, we are unlikely to ever hear that any major artist uses

Maybe it is already happening. Just in areas of production most 
listeners will never find out about, or are even interested in.

Have you noticed that nearly all the new movies with any computer geek 
has the geek using a form of x windows? It ain't running on a M$ or mac 
setup.

true.
but personally i find that there is such an *insanely* large amount of music
around that i dont have time to even listen to the obvious stuff, let
alone spent time searching out obscure stuff that may vary from great to
truely awful :-)



dont discount the large percentage of big budget releases that are
made not by the artist but by a producer in combination with an
engineer. There are many good producers and engineers who are fully
aware of what tools are available irrespective of what other people
use. Some of them will use linux when the tools do the job they require.
Most linux tools are not designed to be used in a commercial enviroment
where you are paying $1000/day for a studio. Some of them are not
far off tho.

personally it irks me that pros are no longer catered for by
commercial software as the user base is too small for it to be
profitable. Instead they are stuck with crap like Protools.



I always enjoy that!
although the Enterprise 'computer', despite looking like the Ion wm,
is really a Director app i'm told :-)

Hallo,

just a short information question: Is it true, that Redhat does not
provide any ALSA packages themselves so people who want to run some of
the many ALSA applications on Redhat will have to use third-party
rpm's like Fernando's or from freshrpms.net? Is this really true? If
yes, does someone know what RH's plans are regarding ALSA on kernel
2.6?

What, exactly, do you mean by music that could be released by a major
label?  That really has nothing to do with the tools used to record,
mix, and master the music.  It has to do with the music and the
performers.  It also has to do with how the song was mixed and
mastered.  The tools are available in Linux to do this.  I'm waiting for
Ron Parker to wade in on this subject since he is running a working
studio.  Check out http://myweb.cableone.net/eviltwin69/gmc2.ogg.  This
is sort of a blues tune.  Bruce Iglauer at Alligator Records (largest
blues label in the world) liked it.  I don't think he really cared what
it was recorded, mixed, or mastered on.  Unfortunately, as with all
bands, that one folded due to it's own internal problems.  If you want
to find some music done with Linux you need to check out Dave Phillips'
Linux Sound and MIDI page - http://linux-sound.org/.  Specifically the
Linux Music On-line section.

Jan,
   I like the tune. Good job, and that counts whether this was done on
Linux or not.

oh no! I mean SuperCollider the music language app. look at 
http://www.audiosynth.com
and help make the linux port of SC server! 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/supercollider/

as to my original point, it's mostly being summed up in the other 
thread of mp3 vs. ogg etc...



originally, I wrote to respond to questions regarding a lack of 
prebuilt tools, a small user base, etc. I was giving my perspective 
as an educated, experienced studio and computer music user, but 
coming from the professional and academic worlds wherein we all used 
Macintosh. My point was that I was excited by the prospect of 
learning morel, being on the cutting edge, being in the community of 
Linux users, but that, even as an experienced user, I was finding it 
very very difficult to make the transition, but I thought it might be 
intersting to understand why I was learning linux. The philosophizing 
came in the form of questions like: "is it a good thing or a bad 
thing to be an elite group of users?" "do linux audio users want to 
exist as part of a specifically educated group or to make it useable 
by joe-reason user?" basically pointing out that when you become so 
far inside a specific knowledge base it is sometimes hard to see how 
opaque it may appear from outside --cf. improv or avant-garde music 
cliques...

I was just poking the hornet's nest, as usual. please don't take this 
sort of response as complaining! I am really happy with the available 
sounds and software and you can expect a note somewhere on any 
releases i make from now on that linux was used.

Uffda.  Sorry about that.  It was 6:30 in the morning, and I hadn't been to bed yet ;)

Mostly, I'm just frustrated by the examples provided on the web sites for open-source synths and drum machine apps.  I should have either kept my mouth shut, though, or written a less nebulous explanation of what I'm hoping for.

Sorry.

Thanks Mark.  That one is a bizarre hybrid.  Recorded on an Alesis ADAT
system, mixed on some type of hardware mixer (not sure exactly what),
and mastered in Linux using JAMin.  The Fuzzy Dice demo stuff
(http://myweb.cableone.net/eviltwin69/fuzzy.html) was all Linux -
Ardour, JAMin, Audacity (trim, fade in/out, and ogg encoding).  That was
done with a much earlier version of Ardour.  The latest (0.9beta5) is
pretty darn awesome.  I can't wait till Paul starts selling the manual. 
I definitely want one!

Jan

Oh!  I was very confused about that.  I was sitting there thinking "what
does a giant particle accelerator have to do with Linux audio"?  I'd
never heard of the SuperCollider audio synth project.  That's what
happens when you spend all your time with a bunch of scientists.  Thanks
for clearing that up.

Jan

0630 huh.  You must have been playing a gig.  I got home at 0430 this
morning.  I know what you mean as far as drum machine apps are
concerned.  I haven't found one yet that I'm really all that happy
with.  If you find a good one let us know.  No need to apologize here. 
The linux audio lists - audio user, alsa, jack, ardour, jamin, etc are
about the most civilized mailing lists I've ever seen.  If you really
want to get seriously flamed go post anything on prosoundweb.  Those
guys are brutal ;-)  The Mixerman chronicles are well worth the read
though if you can stand all of your laugh muscles getting sore.

Jan








-->><<--__-->><<--

sorry for any confusion. Just to clarify:

when i refer to "major labels" (which i didnt), i mean
Universal, Warners, Sony, and BMG.

Ron is a shining example to us all. Personally i make
european pop music which requires a lot more from your
system than just capturing, editing, and playing back audio
through a desk + outboard. European music is much more electronic
than US stuff. It makes me laugh that people in the US even have
an 'electronica' category. 
With the exception of vocals, there are no "performances"
in the conventional sense. Most of the sounds are generated
on the machine and need to be kept live to be able to
make last minute changes. Personally I couldnt even manage without a
large amount of
hardware dsp. This is a worst case scenario of course,
but if you are being paid you need to be able to cope with that.
Its quite a difficult requirement to meet, and i think its
an amazing testament to Free Software development that we can even
think of getting there. I'm talking about the equivalent of replacing 
a 96 ch ssl with everything that goes with it, which is the 
level that i infer when people talk about "major releases". 
However that is not to say that you cant do great stuff with very
little equipment, its just that when the budget is big you
tend to have lots of equipment at your disposal, for good or ill.

But this is all my own personal perspective and i dont neccesarily
want to impose it on anyone else. Just goes to show that there 
is a v diverse range of people here i guess :-)

Hi,
 

LoL, aint it the truth! 

I find it encouraging that so many people are
convinced they need Protools. That reality is a wide
open door of opportunity for LAD. I try not to think
about this as a commercial opportunity even though I
make my living as an engineer, producer and studio
owner. For me it's about the music and friendships. 

LAD people have some great tools and we're gonna make
alot of new friends because we've got something to
share. Think about it this way, the next musician is
your blood brother/sister. What do you want for your
sister? I want herto be free. We're gonna "turn on"
alot of people.

We have the silver version of a multi-platinum single
hanging on the wall of our studio--the original tracks
were produced by my partner. That piece of crap was
produced with an 8bit sampler. I'll eat monkey farts
for breakfast before I recommend that my sister
purchase Protools and succomb to the "man".
Incidentally, my pallet is a little more sophisticated
than animal excrement--it's all about the Kraft
Mac&Cheese for this dawg.

During Novemeber my band will begin producing its new
album. I've done a couple of real fun productions over
the years and this one promises to be Mac&Cheese with
a glass of cold milk. My friends who will work on this
album all know about LAD. They are excited, in part
because of your tools and philosiphy. My friends and I
are like tractor repairmen who do not feel good about
buying new axels. We feel good when we fire up the
welder and fix the broken parts ourselves. We've got
everything in common with the tractor repairman. We
need that satisfaction.

I know this community is gonna produce alot of good
music.

When the delta blues musicians sang, "my baby done me
wrong," baby was a reference to the plantation owner
(I learned that on TV and know it to be the truth,
hehe). Those men were not obbsesed with how baby had
hurt their feelings. They were outraged by how their
owners were destroying their families. Those people
produced some important music. Perhaps my owner can't
physically intimidate me. However, they have
controlled my intellectual and property freedoms and
they've ignored me. I hate being ignored and that BS
stops here! LoL

Well, there I go opening my big mouth. Again! I'll go
wipe the grease off some dirty wrenches and cease with
the annoying diatribe.

ron






-->><<--__-->><<--

	Yeah, I can see that.  I've never been all that into the electronica
stuff.  I'm more of the grab your axe (of choice) and play kind of guy. 
Not that I don't appreciate the electronic stuff (when it's good).



	I have to disagree with that.  The way you put together what you
hear/sample; that is, your vision of what you're trying to create *is* a
performance.  It may take longer because you do it in pieces but it is
no less relevant than BB King playing a guitar.  What I was saying was
that if you took someone with the best equipment in the world and no
musical vision (that would be me trying to make electronica music ;-)
you'd get crap (GIGO).  Take someone who knows what they're doing, give
them Linux tools and they'll create something good.  My point is that it
isn't the tools that make the "major label" quality it's the
artist/engineer.

I am on Red Hat 9.  When I installed Red Hat 9 on my PC, it recognized 
the sound card.  The sound card was working fine.  RH9 does not include 
ALSA packages.
I installed later the ALSA sound drivers and utilites.
I am usinf artsd as sound server, but sometimes whne I run Mozilla, it 
will force esd to start as sound server if artsd has terminated.

Greetings all:

I am trying to learn about the LADSPA plugins. I have downloaded and
installed the ladspa_sdk, read the ladspa.h header file and read Dave
Phillips article on the O'Reilly network. I've also added the CMT plugin
library.

Okay, so I've got my plugins but I need some helping making them go. I don't
really understand how they work. I am trying to learn about them in a
console environment, that is to say just by themselves (if that is possible,
maybe that is part of the difficulty). I understand the basics of the C
language and the Linux operating system but most of the information I have
found seems to cover developing plugins and consequently goes right over my
head.

Lets say I wanted to use the sine.so plugin from the sample library to play
a continuos pitch from my sound card, how would I do that? I'm confused by
the need of an input file for this as I see the sine.so plugin as the
source. Can the output file be a dev file? How about using the ALSA hw
plugin hw:0,0 as the output, how would I do that? I've read the ALSA library
documentation about plugins and LADSPA but again it goes right over my head.

Anyway, I though I'd ask these questions to this list and see what came of
it. I'm using recent ALSA drivers, with a 2.2.20 kernel on a very old
computer (hence the desire to learn about the plugins from the console).

Thank you in advance for any consideration and advice.

Sincerely,
Paul

Hi there, 
I am looking for a way to improve the sound from an old VHS tape.
The tape has been played an played and played.... the osund has now some 
fluctuations that I'd like to get rid of.

I know how to use SOX, GWC or Audacity but do not have the knowledge about 
sound processing. Bcast 2000 seems to have useful tools as well, but really 
it's above what I know (apart from gain and LPF).

So if anybody has a link, an idea, a trick, anything will do at this stage :-)

Hi,

Obviously you can't regain what's lost. If the product
has never been mastered, then I'd suggest you master
it. JAMin, a jack client, is your friend. JAMin does
not record files so you'll need a jack client wave
editor. There's a several I've used and like Rezound.

If it has been mastered that could be a problem.
Mastering is eq, compression and limiting. If you
compile compression and limiting it will suck. As I'm
sure you can imagine.

The plugins can't be used by themselves - they need a host application,
that provides connections to sound devices, allows you to set control
values etc. 
 

'applyplugin' which comes with the ladspa_sdk assumes you are processing
.wav files, applying a plugin as an effect. Most LADSPA hosts are GUI
driven, and the only commandline host I have found is ecasound (which
does a whole lot more!) - from the ecasound web page:

http://www.wakkanet.fi/~kaiv/ecasound/welcome.html

example to play a sinewave (under 'effects processing'):

ecasound -i null -o /dev/dsp -el:sine_fcac,440,1

(no input, output to /dev/dsp, use ladspa plugin sine_fcac with
frequency 440, amplitude 1)

Use analyseplugin from the ladspa_sdk to get details of the plugin label
and ports.

Ecasound also comes with a nice interactive cli, which allows you to
build 'chains' of plugins amongst other things. The manpages will tell
you all about it.

Hallo,


Cool. Applying this to blackbox, I found, that this is possible there,
too, with commands like: 

KeyToGrab(Right), WithModifier(Mod4), WithAction(ExecCommand), DoThis(alsaplayer --relative -10)

in ~/.bbkeysrc

But actually I now configured the otherwise useless multimedia keys on
my (itouch) keyboard with "hotkeys" like. Thanks for this pointer.
Alsaplayer rulez big time. If only re-sorting of the playlist was
possible, or am I missing something again?

Isn't one of the definitions of a WAV file is that it can merely wrap
another file format?  And usually that format is RIFF, but not
necessarily?

It's the other way around.   RIFF is a wrapper for other file formats,
which usually ends up being WAV.  WAV allows for different encoding
types, if that's what you mean, but the encoding-type-code 0x674F isn't
one of the universally recognized standards (0x0001 corresponds to the
ubiquitous PCM data encoding format).  With this particular file, it
seems that they have a standard WAV header at the beginning of the
file, and where the PCM data normally is they have an ogg.  'Tis quite
funky, really.

Actually, no. IMO determining the file type by the use of magic

Actually it is RIFF that wraps WAV. 

However, take another look at that hexdump. The 'RIFF' chunk enclosed a
'WAVE' chunk and then the Ogg data is contained inside the 'data' chunk.

Personally I think that is dodgy; a typical hack on top of a bodge etc.

Hi

Does anyone know if it's legal to:

* sample the grandpiano of the latest Roland/Korg/Yamaha electric piano
* give the sample away
* package it (sf2) and put it on my web site

IMHO it is totally legal if you do your own recording (you create the
samples yourself, so you own the copyright), this is the way a lot of
sample cds of instruments work.

Ripping sounds from ROMs is impossible under the DMCA, unless you own
the device yourself.

IANAL though :)

Try looking in the manual, sometimes if has explicit resitctions on what =
you
can do with the output to prevent this. I dont know if thats legally
enforcable though.

Ok, next question: What is a nice forum to exchange multisamples or
sf2's? I mean it takes a long time to sample, truncate and loop a
multisampled grand, so sharing would make more sounds available to more
people faster...

i'm working on a microKORG clone in pd, and plan on sampling korg's DWGS

are not with the microKORG.  i apparantly can legally reverse engineer the

It's most likely legal if you record them yourself.

On the other hand, instead of just sampling your synth, why not be
adventurous and add some new sounds to the mix. Do some processing and make
the sounds more interesting. Add rhythms to the samples, timed filters,
something more interesting, a bit of your own expression.

I think that will make the work more valuable and more likely to get used.

FYI - I own a whole slew of old synth GigaStudio libraries. While they are
fun and have their uses, they really haven't been the best purchases I made.
Much more interesting and much more used are the sounds that are unique.

Anyway, just my 2 cents.

Cheers,
Mark





-->><<--__-->><<--
actually... i beg to differ.

you will have a certain element of copyright in your mechanical 
recording of the piano, but the copyright in the sample still belongs to 
korg/roland/yamaha etc, who are likely to be quite protective of them. 
there may, as has been mentioned, be licensing provisions but i'd 
suggest they'd be highly unlikely to extend to relicensing these samples 
for redistribution. if they do allow this - then wahey, i think we 
should all celebrate and start a GPL-distributed sf2 project. but i 
seriously doubt this would be the case. a proprietary company doesnt 
spend millions on developing an electric piano or synth for nothing.

it would be analagious to someone re-recording one of your songs and 
then claiming that they own the copyright on your song.

much as i'd like to be able to, i really can't see any other way around it.

Absolutely, these days the Record industry is more screwed than ever
before in its history, you simply cannot stand a chance of getting signed
unless you're a boy band, or a girl band, basically fake rnb made by
all-singing, all-dancing "fame" type 16 year old kids. i swear to god, if
you're over 16 years old these days you simply won't be signed. A bigger
reason that the industry going under is the focus on the teeny bopper
audience at the expense of any other. There happens to be a huge audience
for creative music here even in the US, but the problem is that the
audiences go to see the established names, many of whom are pushing 60-70
and ignore young, or unknown artists, so those of us with tons of talent
who do creative music simply don't exist to most people, but if you hear
my ripping jazz guitar licks I think you'll see there's just tons and tons
of talented creative musicians who simply can't get gigs or recording
because they're not a "name", but this has nothing to do with the quality
of the music, its all about a small crowd of entertainers and business
people having highjacked our whole culture, and as a creative artist I see
Linux as a means of rebellion, allowing me to make more unique, original
music, not based on the same software and patches that everyone else uses
to make their same-y music.

I imagine you could use Csound to generate wavetables that are similar to
the Korg waves, here you have the added benefit of having cleaner waves,
since you're generating them internally you won't have any recording
artifacts from the korg.

Roland seems to be indeed, this was on Slashdot some days ago: 

http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/10/11/1833213


Hmm, this analogy doesn't seem right. First of all, the samples in a synth
are of course meant to be redistributed in some way. Also there is a 
difference between 'copyright of a song' and 'copyright of a recording'.

Some rap producers are actually re-recording phrases from songs so they don't
have to go through the hassles of sample-clearing.

There are soundfonts of resampled digital synths already available on sites 
like hammersound, but that doesn't have to mean they are 100% legal of course.

Christian



-->><<--__-->><<--

Well, some friends of mine just signed to Palm.  There is still hope of
talented, hardworking bands getting signed.  Besides, there are always

-->><<--__-->><<--

Absolutely, when it's the use of the digital representation basically
right out of their ROM. That's not cool. That's theft. (And I'm not
saying that is what this project was doing. They may just be getting
pushed around with this legal letter.)



Exactly.

As I said earlier, simply recording the existing samples isn't all that
interesting to me. On the other hand, adding some processing, modifying
the sound, and coming up with something much more original would likely
pass the test, and, as far as I know, if you record the analog version
of the sound you are not bound by digital rights management. 

(That said, I'm sure someone here will disagree, so at the outset I'll
just say that's my understanding and is not legal advice.)

Cheers,
Mark

 It's just that here most "real" electronica is constrained to academia or to
experimental/artsy categories ...None of which makes any money. {Actually, that
whole conceptual genre has fallen into real disfavor recently.}

 We have that whole rock/blues and jazz legacy to deal with as well {as opposed
to the watered down, imitative stuff that comes from that side of the pond.} The
American public has come to value things like depth and quality and a certain
"earthiness" that you just don't get with "Eurodisco."

 {Tho' you really couldn't tell it by looking at our charts. ... A few minutes
 on the streets or in some of our backwoods clubs would convince you.}




-->><<--__-->><<--

The minor labels are probably much better for you in the long haul
as an artist. Being on a major doesn't guarantee you anything, in
fact if you're *lucky* you will merely fail to make any money.

Some acquaintances of mine put out two records on RCA, one in '96
and one in '98, and despite a great live show, some good 
reviews and some "modern rock" airplay here and there, they got no 
promotional backup - e.g. they'd find out their song had been played
regularly on a radio station in an area they could have easily travelled
to & performed, but they'd be told about this long *after* the song had
been cycled out of airplay. The general impression was that nobody
at the label was paying attention.

And they got off pretty easy, they just got dropped after 
the second album failed to do much of anything.
For a real horror story read those prosoundweb "mixerman diaries"
that somebody posted a day or two ago. So horrible it's almost funny.
It could be subtitled "How to fail in the record industry by spending
2 million dollars on total shit."

Well, amongst our happy family of Linux Audio Users right here on this
list we have at least one very accomplished Electronica composer by the
name of Natasha Barrett. I purchased one of her CDs (yes, it was
actually available here in the US) and really dig it. I've listened to
it at least a dozen times in the last 2 weeks. (Be forwarned, it is
abstract in nature, but deliciously so...)

Natasha - please forgive me if I should not refer to your work as
'Electronica'. To my mind (and ear) it goes in that basic area, but I
probably don't have the education to try and classify it any further.

All I'll say is that at least this composer's work has not fallen into
disfavor with me.

That's why csound is so handy for creating sound-alike custom ROMs, you
can make a bunch of patches that sound roland-esque, but if it comes
down to it, you can show the code for your original sounds.




-->><<--__-->><<--
That's not totally accurate, the US audience is just super into "retro",
hearing bands rehash all the styles of old. You've got a much better
chance of making it playing in a cover band than trying to do original
music, but really if you listen to what a very commercial producer like
Timbaland is doing, he's really pushing things by bringing in indian
samples and african/indian style pecussion, played by hand.

Most Linux artists are either academics who teach linux music for a
living, or indie hackers like me. However I'm demoing terminatorX at
SCALE this year and I'm lookign at writing some terminatorX articles for
Dj magazines, so I haven't given up on my own music, but if you look at
sucessfully underground artists liek Nels Cline, it takes years and
years of relentless dedication to just get by.

Part of that is that musicians are mostly limiting themselves to
thinking in terms of releasing only audio.

For me I'm really getting into video art and am working hard to climb
the learning curve on everything, learning to use Blender and building
opengl stuff to release dvd's and 3D gamesfor $$. 

The thing is if you look at the statistics, DVD's sales are really the
thing that's cutting down on CD sales, more people are buying movies
instead of albums. So the thing to do is release you own DVD's for $$,
because people are more willing to pay $20 for an exxperimental DVD than
$5 for a CD.

I'm sure it isn't quite that simple either.  I suspect it's one of 
those murky things that has never properly been tested either way.

The whole purpose of these instruments is to be performed, recorded, 
and otherwise redistributed.  That's what they sell them for.  
Imagine you put out a minimal electro track recorded with a Roland 
instrument (as many have done) and described it on the back as a 
recording of a Roland instrument.  Could they sue you for that?  
Would you need to acknowledge their copyright in the samples even as 
you retained copyright in the song?  What exactly is the difference 
between that and a sample CD?  Is it "fair use" to use a certain 
selection of the available range of notes, but wholesale piracy to 
duplicate the entire pitch range?  Is it just about intention?

People here have referred to licensing provisions, but I'm not at all 
convinced that embedded software distributed as an integral part of a 
device that is undoubtedly _sold_ to you (not licensed) could ever be 
legally said to be licensed rather than sold, and I'm certainly not 
sure that any such license could be said to cover the results of 
running the software (that is, the sounds).

How far would such a company get in suing you for putting out a 
soundfont recorded from one of their _acoustic_ grand pianos?  What 
about a violin maker?  (OK, that'd doubtless be an awful soundfont, 
but you get the idea.)  Again, what is the difference?  The synth has 
software in it, sure, but you're not copying the software.

Ethically, I happen to think that duplicating a Roland in free 
software is a pretty dubious activity.  Legally, I reckon Roland 
could probably bring enough vague threats to get your ISP to pull the 
site you distributed it from, but I'm not at all persuaded they'd win 
a case in court, even in the US.  Not that I know anything worth 
knowing about this, of course: I'm just enjoying theorising about it.

I know that laws requiring some sort of artistic/aesthetic judgement for
their enforcement are on thin ice, but surely it's easy to determine the
intention here. Either you are a recording a piece of music (legitimate
use) or you are making a carefully graded set of copies of the sample
data for use by anyone who wants to clone the instrument (arguably not
legitimate). I can't believe that it would require much of an expert
witness to decide which was the intention in any specific case.

Before someone starts on sampling, my point is that nobody produces a
recording of music with the *intention* that it should be sampled and
used in something else, unless it's something like a sound effects
cellection in which case that intention is quite clear and the copyright
statement would be worded accordingly.

Well, further down my email I asked: Is it just about intention?  
Copyright law doesn't normally appear (as far as I can see) to take 
intention into account, apart from in certain specific situations 
such as fair use or parody.  If you accidentally duplicate someone 
else's tune, the fact that it was unintentional might mitigate the 
damages but it won't save your case, as artists have discovered.  And 
the legal problem with sampling is not that you're using a recording 
in a way other than what was intended, but that you're simply 
violating copyright by recording and redistributing it at all.  
Intention in the latter situation is surely only relevant in 
determining whether someone is liable for actual damages.

A sample CD permits use by including an effective waiver of copyright 
in certain situations, that works in the same sort of way as the GPL: 
a statement that if you do certain things that would normally be 
copyright violations, you won't be sued.  Are you suggesting that the 
only reason recordings of Rolands are permitted is that Roland are 
similarly generously prepared to overlook the copyright violations 
inherent in them and decline to take you to court?  Or that synths 
also need to come with a statement expressly permitting you to use 
them as musical instruments, and that recording any synth without 
such a license would technically be a copyright violation?

You see we're talking about two separate things here: the copyright 
inherent in a "work" (in this case the sound of a synth) and any 
additional rights granted or restricted by licence.  The sounds in a 
sample CD are probably copyrighted, but you have additional rights to 
use them in certain ways.  The question is: are the sounds in a synth 
copyrighted at all?  If so, where are the additional rights coming 
from that permit me to record them in a commercial song?

then, wouldn't they mention it somewhere?  especially on a new piece of

my microKORG manual, and the unit itself, says nothing.  only the manual 
itself has a copyright.  i don't remember any restrictions on my sy85, 
either (but it's in the states, and i'm in korea).


the sounds in my microKORG and sy85 were never licensed to me.  i bought 
the instuments for their sounds (perhaps to make recordings which i could 
sell and own all the rights to), whether i do something minimal or complex 
with them is up to me.

these companies are in the hardware business, and with all the advances in 
softsynths (etc) these days, hardware is still very popular (even with 
me, who is cheap and a geek).


it might be analogious to someone covering your song, and claiming the 
recording of their performance of your song (whether you gave them 
permission to use it or not).

Ok, I wasn't going to say anything, but now I can't help it :-)

Thank you for saying that.  Please understand that I am a hobbyist
not a career musician, so making money at music is not as big a deal
for me as it may be for some.  At some point I made a decision to not
pursue a career in the music industry b/c the industry so often seems
to take away much of the art (just like every other industry).  So I
pursued another career that hopefully supports my music hobby. 
Unfortunately, I often find myself distracted at my day job by
music-related diversions (as I am now).

Anyway, my point is, so much of what I do musically is an attempt to
not conform totally to the mass-produced norm.  For example, a couple
of years ago I needed a Strat-style guitar.  The last thing I wanted
to do was buy a Strat because *everybody* has a Strat.  So I bought a
customized G&L, which you might argue is the same thing, but really,
it's not.  It's just different enough to make a personal statement.
For me Linux is the same way.  My DAW has the oppurtunity to be *my
DAW*, not somebody (or everybody) else's Protools or Cakewalk.  And
that applies both sonically and visually.  As a producer (and I use
the term very loosely) that personalization factor is very important
to me.

It's not so much about non-conformity as it is about creativity. 
There's a point where the commercial offerings stop creating because
they have something that's functional and it costs so much with such
high risk to be creative that they are not willing to go there.  The
open source people don't have so much on the line and are willing to
exercise their creativity a lot more.  If it flops, we just throw it
away and work on something else.  So you get all the cool synth
packages that have come out and really unique things like Jack

So it might not ever be palatable to the masses because it's too
innovative.  It's the same reason why Creed will always sell more
tickets than Dream Theater, but I will always listen to DT more than
I will Creed.  Creativity vs. following trends.  Have I totally
missed the point?

OTOH, the tools, like the music needs to be commercially viable, at
least for those who choose to make their living off of it.  And I
think it could be and someday will be.  It would be a shame for all
this cool innovation to only be accessible to programmers --
especially since many of the developers are going out of their way to
make it accessible to non-programmers.

I'll stop rambling now.

The free sampled piano is here:
http://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/MIS.html  (click on the Piano link)

It is quite large, abot 1.5GB (each note sampled individually in 3 
velocities: pp, mf, ff).
I do not know how good the quality of this piano is, Steve Harris
hacked together a small player and posted some mp3s that were rendered 
from a MIDI file driving his application.
To me it does not sound that great, perhaps you need to tune
the velocity splits to make it sound well.

Anyway this sampleset is really large and can hardly fit into RAM.
SF2 was not created to be streamed from disk thus I suggest the following.

We of the linuxsampler team made significant progress in .GIG playback
thanks to the wonderful work done by Christian S.
He actually wrote libgig which is able to parse and load .GIG file
supporting all the articulation stuff (layering, key/velocity switching,
  dimensions etc).

see our new webpage (thanks Marek ;-) )
http://www.linuxsampler.org

(the new code is not online yet, because Christian and I are fixing bugs
and optimizing the streaming).

I cannot make forecasts when full GIG playback will be done, but shortly
  (1-2 weeks) we will release a version that can play back the samples
(without effects, and envelopes for now).

This means we will soon be able to play the MIS piano directly streamed 
from disk using LinuxSampler.

So the advice to Atti and others is:
One of you should use a Windows app which allows you to create .GIG 
files (with GigaStudio being the natural choice), download the MIS 
samples, tune volume, velocity-splits, trim samples (some samples have a 
bit of silence at the beginning etc) and make a .GIG file out of it.

After the piano sounds good in GigaStudio you should post it online.
That way as soon as LinuxSampler is ready (the piano sample does not 
require filters, envelopes etc) we can release a truly free
Grandpiano in software (samples + player).

To compare how well the MIS piano .GIG you will create ,sounds I suggest 
you to use this page:

http://www.af.lu.se/~fogwall/piano.html

On that page you find a classical music midi file
Fantaisie-Impromptu (Chopin)

and the corresponding audio clips rendered with various
digital pianos, hardware expanders and software samples
(including VST The Grand, various multi-Gigabyte piano samples for
Gigasampler etc).

Not sure about the quality we can achieve, for example the MIS piano
does not include pedal down samples.
IANAPP (I am not a piano player)  so I do not know if this is a big
disadvantage that makes it sound unprofessional.

Worth a try anyway.

What do you think ?

cheers,
Benno

Man, the similarities between those images and my mental image of the
guitar I wanted are striking.  The G&L I ended up with has the
Blueburst finish (standard color of the Commanche, but on a Legacy)
with chrome hardware.  I went with a maple neck though I almost got
ebony and sometimes wish I had.

I'm currently thinking about modding my Sovtek amp head into a combo
instead of buying "everybody else's Fender tube amp" :-)

Benno,
   I am a GigaStudio user, but I;'ve never built a complicated .gig
file. Are you looking for someone to do this? If so, I could check it
out and see what I can come up with.

   If you are just looking for someone to test the gig file someone else
here makes, I'd be very happy to do that.

   In either case I would certainly compare the sound of this gig file
with the sounds I get for the 4 grand piano gig libraries I've
purchased.

   Let me know how I might be able to help the most.

Cheers,

Hi,
   I'm not clear if this is possible at all. Can someone explain how I
might make a .asoundrc file that would only allow applications that use
OSS emulation to access specific playback channels.

   Currently any app that uses OSS emulation drives all 26 playback
channels on my HDSP 9652. This causes two problems:

1) Since my hardware mixes the 26 inputs into 2 stereo output pairs, the
output over-drives if the 26 inputs are loud.

2) Any app using OSS emulation blocks all other apps using OSS
emulation.

   What would be great, if it can be done, is to create a sort of
'virtual OSS' device in .asoundrc that only drove specific Alsa playback
channels, so that Mozilla, for instance, talked to a specific entry in
.asoundrc and ended up only driving two specific playback channels, like
playback_22 and playback_23.

   I would be willing to live with a requirement that all OSS apps had
to use the same sampling rate or blocking would occur. That's not an
issue for me.

   Is anything like this possible with Alsa?

Thanks,
Mark

Hmmm, that should have been Atte, but ok :-)


I do not have access to a windows partition, so... I would rather give
it the best shot at creating a (few) sf3(s) of the samples. This could
also prove useful to some people (for instance me, that always run
everything from csound anyways)...


I didn't know that the project was that mature, looking forward to
checking it out.


Great idea. I'll give that a go with my sf2-version.


I personally don't think it's *that* important. Let's see...

For me, the reality of running a sound business hurts
like a hammer slapped upside the head. It's hard to
design and execute any business plan. All I really
want to do is arrange and perform music with my
friends.

I think if all our bands had a Col. Parker (of Elvis
fame) in our camps, we'd never miss the opportunity to
tour into a market where our material is getting radio
play. I don't think the management that comes with a
label contract is the same thing you get from a
personal band manager.

What little I observe of KISS tells me that Gene
Simmons is a hell of a businessman. The guy breeds
success. In fact, it's easy to imagine that he breeds
alot.

My studio business partner experienced some success
while signed to an independent lable. I saw BMI
royalty checks of up to $40,000.00 USD from S. Afrika
to Finland and everywhere inbetween. There were no
mechanical royalties. When they tossed the indie label
owner into prison for embezzlement they seized an
estate that included; large home, sports cars, SSL
mixers, etc, etc. All of it purchased from revenues of
their product. What happened to the seized estate? We
don't know and it's unlikely we ever will.

Related to that deal were publishing revenues
originally owned by Motown but transfered to the major
that purchased them. Several years went by without
anyone even knowing that a publishing royalty existed.
It was discovered by accident during the embezzlment
investigations. Even after discovery it took a couple
years to collect. The label, when asked why the
publishing royalty hadn't been delivered, replied, "we
didn't have your mailing address."

I think bands need talented, trustworthy and motivated
business persons if they want to make money. But my
ultimate point is, I'm gonna go play the drums!

Has anyone done any comparisions in terms of realtime performance of any
of the softsynths.

I was interested in seeing results of the following or possibley other synths compared:

csound
pd
sfront

I was curious how well sfront performs because you can optimise that for
your instruments to your processor. It seems rather interesting that the
instruments get translated into c code that you then later compile with
gcc. I know pd probably has a faster developement time similar to
writing something in perl but is the execution performance the same as
say sfront or csound?  What has better performance for real time stuff
csound or sfront?

<SNIP>

Benno,
   I started to wonder why we need to do this? There are a large number of
open-source GIG files on the net. Two of the most notable sites to get them
are:

http://www.worrasplace.com  (Currently down, but coming)

which I pointed out in this forum last December, and

http://62.13.11.115/gtown/ (Currently up, and staying, I hope!) ;-)

with some great gig files sampled at Grebbestad Church.

wouldn't using those gig files provide more than enough confirmation that
any sampler work that was going on here did indeed work with standard gig
files?

Or has this been done already?

Cheers,
Mark

My apartment in San Jose was burglarized in 1980. I lost a 1979 Gibson RD
Artist (not a great guitar) and a 1937 Gibson Super 400. (Which was an
immensely great guitar.)  I had the same issues about buying a Strat, so I
went with a 1980 or 81 G&L F-100 Series II and have never looked back. This
one is not mine, but looks identical.

synths compared:

Sorry. Not clear. I listen a lot to jazz fusion, like John Scofield or John
McLaughlin, or then a lot of prog rock stuff like Spock's Beard or
Conspiracy. None of this is represented on the radio today, really. (In
reference to your "that whole rock/blues and jazz legacy" comment, which I
agree with.)

My unintelligible comment about black artists was only that this week
everything on the radio is hip hop, rap or what passes taday as R&B, even
though I have a hard time equatig Beyonce Knowles, no matter how good
looking or talented she is, with R&B. Nothing on commercially driven radio
around her has anythign to do with, again, "that whole rock/blues and jazz
legacy".

I hope this helps explain my point of view a bit, even if it is out of
touch.

-->><<--__-->><<--

but the problem is they are relatively small.
Ok that organ is probably nice (100MB .GIG) but have you ever seen a 
free 1.5GB piano on the net ?
AFAIK there aren't any so I think the guy that will build the MIS .GIG 
file would make a good service
to those that want free high quality samples.

I don't understand exactly that you mean.
In linuxsampler we initially support AKAI S1000/2000 and GIG so that 
users can tap into
the large pool of existing high quality sample libraries.
Of course the more samples we test libakai and libgig with the easier it 
will be to spot
 bugs and compatiblity problems.

cheers,
Benno






-->><<--__-->><<--

exactly, if you (or others) are experienced with GigaStudio you could 
try to assemble a .GIG instrument.
Basically you just download the .aiff files, convert them to WAV (I 
guess GS cannot read .aiff)
and edit them (mainly trimming silence at the beginning, at least one 
sample as far I remember,
has a a few wrong samplepoints in it which cause a bit of distortion, 
but I guess you can fix it
easily with a sample editor).
Then create a new instrument, load the file into GS and map them on each 
key.
(3 samples (pp,mf,ff) per key).
At that point the instrument is ready. The only thing you need to tune 
at that point is the
velocity splitting eg. how to divide the 0-127 velocity space in 3 parts.
I don't know if this velocity optimization has to be done once per key 
or globally.
(probably to get best results you need to do it on a per key basis).
I would advise you to play the Chopin MIDI file on the piano comparison 
page and see if the velocity
mapping sounds convincing.

cheers,
Benno

Hi all,

With the profusion of good, legal, lossless, and free .flac files 
floating around the net, I was looking for a good way to burn sets of 
them to CD.  The only burner I have on my system at the moment is 
GnomeToaster, so I set about doing it.  I hear that Arson for KDE can do 
it, and maybe K3B can to.  I have a feeling that if I set my mind to it 
I could write a script to do this, but Gnometoaster is pretty nice. 
Perhaps more industrious folks will use the ideas to do on the fly DAO 
in other burners.

The instructions are here:
http://nutation.net/blog/2003/10/14#flac2cd

If those instructions work for you, you should be creating gapless CDs 
from FLACs in addition to whatever other audio files you have in an easy 
manner.

Feel free to respond to me and/or the list if you have any questions.

-Rich




-->><<--__-->><<--

Sure, but as I pointed out in the next email, I think there's not a good
reason to go through that effort just yet:

1) There are free piano libraries out there, or you can buy one starting at
probably $39 or so. East-West comes to mind.

2) Today's best GSt pianos are doing 16 (or more) layers pedal up, 16 (or
more) layers pedal down AND release samples. It does make a big difference
to have both pedal down and release samples.

If you hardware cannot handle that library, then these high end libraries
all ship stripped down versions that use just pieces, like only pedal up and
no release, to ease the burden on hardware. Even the high-end ones only run
about $200, so at 33 samples * 88 notes or about 2500 wave files, someone
has to really WANT to do this because it's only costing about 10 cents per
wave file and they have a better piano so sample.

This still comes back, in my mind as a GSt user for about 3 years, to having
some sounds that are worthwhile. Taking an existing synth, or piano, and
doing some processing to make something new will be more useful than just
another GSt piano library.

BTW - do you know about the Piano Shootout page?

http://www.purgatorycreek.com/pianocompare.html

There must be close to 100 piano libraries right now just on this site...

- Mark







-->><<--__-->><<--


Why should *anyone* build a gig file out of those publicly available wave
files when there are already 10 or more free pianos out there. What value do
we get by investing the effort to make that gig file?

Maybe I'm not understanding your point of view. I can send you on CD 500
free gig files. If you want to test, then that will give more value, I
think, than making one new one.

Just my 2 cents.

Mine's actually in pretty good shape, other than a single ding in the
varnish it got years ago. It's sort of nice to know that you bought the
guitar early enough in the companies history that Leo might have been around
watching it get made.

About 2 years ago I took it to a professional to have the frets looked after
and to get it setup and intonated. The guitar plays wonderfully. It is a G&L
though, so it certainly has it's own tone. Not a Strat, but in the same
area. It can scream when it needs too.

Today I pick up a Les Paul and it feels so strange. I played an SG the other
day that I really liked. I haven't tried too many of the new brands. I still
intend to get an old Rickenbacker one of these days, like George played, and
some day an Alembic bass probably. Lots of great instruments out there.

Cheers,
Mark

heheh - you're late to the dance Paul -

The one on the left I made in 1989 the one on the right was made in 1999
with four more in between.  All hand made, neck-thru, oil and wax
finish.  They''re getting a little worn but I play them both in bands. 
I would suggest you get Melvyn Hiscock's book - Make Your Own Electric
Guitar.  Check out http://www.stewmac.com they have pretty much anything
you need.  Do the inlay yourself - it's a lot easier than it looks (you
do need a Dremel router though).  There's a great book on it at Stew
Mac.  Building a guitar is about as rewarding an experience as you can
have - have fun.

I that case I'd just finagle access to a grand piano at calarts and
sample it myself :-), which is just what I'm doing with some classical
and rock guitar patches I'm developing, though csound can make
guitar-like sounds, its easier to maipulate nylon string classical
samples for what I'm working on.

Anyways its all about going the extra mile, I'm really puny and slow
compared to what some of my ex-classmates have done, Douglas has done
some insane stuff with what I call his "emoto-bots", he had this cookie
tin that would vibrate when you pet it right that was really cool way
back in '97, and Ryan Francesoni built his own mac performance software.

Me, I just learned to build terminatorX from cvs, and that sh*t took me
5 years to learn :-).=20

But I'm working on csound to be able to produce my own custom patches
for my asrx sampler and soundfonts as well. Also csound is great for
doing algorithmic composition, my goal right now is to develop a good
algorithm for some trippy stuff with csound under linux and then port it
to a custom jsyn applet and release the source as well so people can
enjoy my algorithm under windows and osx as well as linux.

not at all.  You said what I was too lazy to elaborate about :)


I will risk a little exaggeration but I think I could relate the people who 
now use the tools available in linux (at whatever degree of useability they 
are) to those who poioneered the analog production and music making 
techniques in the 20's 30's 40's 50's.  Look how long it took from the first 
piece of 'electroacoustic/acousmatic' music piece in the 30's (Pierre Henry 
et Pierre Shaeffer) to use of sampling (as the only sound source) in the pop 
music (70's?) and even now there are no artists that come to mind (among the 
most selling ones) who do it nearly as creatively as those 2 guys did in the 
30's (save, perhaps, for some of the more 'experimental' pieces of Aphex 
Twins).  I can see, 40 years from now, linux as _the_ platform for sound 
recording/production/performance... or rather some derivative...

If you make a tune with your synth and publish it as public domain, so
anybody can use parts of it and then someone uses a part of it, let's say
one grand piano sample, could (s)he be sued then by the synth
manufacturer? Normally you could sue the 'ripper', but since you already
gave permission to rip, (s)he should be safe.

How about if you make 'artistic' tune, which consists of grand piano
samples played from C-0 to C-9 in half note steps and in different
volumes. Now apply the same scenario as in the first case. What happens?

And if synth manufacturer sues someone for making synth's samples
available, what do you think how it affects the synth's sale? "Use synth X and get
sued by X's manufacturer."


Tommi Uimonen



-->><<--__-->><<--
 

My guess is that in the real world nothing happens, because there is
more to a synthesiser than just a collection of samples.

My previous argument was that the obvious intention behind that ruled
out a 'fair use' defence, but apparently copyright law doesn't say
anything about intention. I still think that the above scenario crosses
the 'fair use' line, thugh the jury's still out on whether the samples
were copyright in the first place.

great link.  i forgot about them.  while i don't think negitivland

there are some great links on that site dealing with fair use, ip, and the 
RIAA (which has nothing to do with korg/roland/yamaha/etc).
perhaps sampling the DWGS from my microKORG to create a software

provide instructions on how to create them, then.  of course, right now 
i'm in korea, and copyright is pretty much ignored here. hrm...

 Music hasn't always had to be formula to make it. The 'net's made major changes in the public's tastes in the past decade or so {at it was until it got "bought".}

i'm very much a supporter of negativland and if you follow the links in 
my sig youll see that we were honoured to have them sign our petition. 
but negativland are, (like me), anti-copyright activists. what they do 
is either *deliberately* breaking the law, or bending it and playing 
around in the grey areas. it takes skill and knowledge. for example, 
most of their work can be classed as fair use under parody or 
journalistic comment exceptions. the same goes for my Madonna Remix 
Project. and thats why Madonna didnt sue us - because she couldnt. 
unfortunately the same *doesnt* apply for taking samples.

i am trying to encourage people to license their work under the Creative 
Commons (www.creativecommons.org) or under a Free or Open Audio license, 
because this would permit us to share work and build Free/Open samplers 
in this way. that is the purpose of my www.copyleftmedia.org.uk website 
- which is now one of the supporting organisations involved in porting 
Creative Commons to Europe (iCommons). i want to build a repository of 
work licensed so that we can freely share and learn from it - thats what 
Larry Lessig refers to as the 'Commons', and thats what copyright in the 
way it is applied today is taking away from us and from our children.

but as far as the law goes, you still need to be very careful at present 
if you want to avoid a lawsuit while you're building your sampler. 
Negativland and John Oswald (www.plunderphonics.com) deliberately break 
the law to make their protests heard. Adbusters are similiar, although 
most of their work is still covered under parody as fair use. whatever 
you do, do it in an informed way, and with good knowledge of the law. i 
would be more than happy to put up links to a sampler made as a 
'protest' work on my website, in the same way that i support other great 
software that is being marginalised because of oppressive legislation 
(remember Vsound?). but in doing what i do, i've spent 2 1/2 years 
studying national and international copyright law, being involved in the 
debates, protests, and making sure my knowledge is sound before i take 
any action myself. otherwise i just make a fool of myself and of the cause.

the copyright exists in the waveform and the sound library. you can't 
copyright A400 Hz but you can copyright a preset.
it all goes back again to what i was saying about reasonable effort 
being put into creating a work.

the sounds from a synth are normally licensed under the EULA in such a 
way that the sound presets themselves are protected, but the creation of 
any work from them is not. it cannot be - you are the one who makes 
'reasonable effort' to create a work from them. the judgement of how 
much effort you put into a work is part of judging whether it can be 
copyrighted.

 Sorry.


 I meant "core" stuff... like old-school jazz, blues, country... "real" rock ...even classical. 
 
 Are you seeing "legacy" as bad? ...Somehow limiting?


 :} Not at all. I haven't believed the label "R&B" since around the end of the original Motown sound.

 I tend to wonder why folk reference past movements that way. {Like Billy Ray Cyrus, or whoever happens to be todays twang pop superstar, calling themselves a "country" singer or whatever...}


 :} Not really... These days I think it might be the ideations of the producer that matters. It would seem that some sort of late seventies nostalgia has grasped us by the sensibilities in the past few years.

 Maybe it's a pre-revolutionary sphincter convulsion sort of thing... maybe it's the result of some secretive neo-conservative underground... who knows?







-->><<--__-->><<--

So a synth sold with no EULA can be freely copied?

It does seem that the situation must be either (1.) the only reason 
you can't copy the thing is that it comes with an EULA preventing it, 
or (2.) the sounds are copyright and there is some special provision 
(either a GPL-style waiver from the copyright holder in a supplied 
licence, or something in law, or simply an unstated convention not to 
sue) for using them in music.  Option 1 seems more credible to me, 
though there  certainly are synths (my Kurzweil for example) that 
come with no EULA.


That doesn't follow, logically. You're saying that if you make 
reasonable effort in a creative work then you have copyright over it, 
but that doesn't exempt you from any charge of infringing copyright 
in doing so. 

I'm sure there is a good argument there, if I just saw how it was 
framed in legal or logical terms.

That aside, even if the activity was technically legal, I suspect in 
real life you'd probably lose to one or more of:

 * an argument based on an EULA that you implicitly agreed to when 
ripping open the box
 * an argument from commercial law such as trademark infringement or 
passing off
 * an argument based explicitly on digital copyright -- copying the 
samples or other code straight from the ROM is almost certainly 
illegal, so one could argue that resampling them is just a less 
accurate way of attempting the same thing
 * an argument that required you to demonstrate that you hadn't 
actually copied the samples straight from ROM and tweaked them a bit 
to hide your tracks
 * an appeal to previous cases related to sampling, relying on an 
intuitive understanding of the original samples as creative works, 
without really solving the problem of whether they were truly 
copyrightable or not
 * a perfectly sound case based on copyright law, in which it turns 
out that it is indeed only "an unstated convention not to sue" that 
protects people making music (!)
 * vague legal threats against you and your ISP aimed at ending 
distribution and costing you more money than you can afford.

That's all assuming Roland or whoever actually cared, of course.

Nice. Installation went smooth as silk and the app plays well. Have you 
noticed that WINE now supports JACK ?

If you have the time, try LeafDrums2 and let me know how it works for 
you. I had it playing very well under RH 7.2 and WINE but now it just 
hangs (I'm now on PlanetC's RH 9).

-->><<--__-->><<--

It seems to me that synths were invented before the current conception 
of 'intellectual property'. I doubt Robert Moog was thinking - 'hey, 
every time someone makes a Bach record on this thing, I can claim a 
10% royalty'. Selling the synth itself was the business model.

The problem as I see it is that there are now a whole load of business 
models based on non-tangible property, usually delivered in a digital 
form. You can sell or licence the sound of a piano, even though you 
didn't invent or even build the piano.

It's clear that some things aren't physical property, and yet we are 
being told that than can be bought and sold in exactly the same way. 
I think it was George Bernard Shaw who put it like this: "We each 
have an apple. I give you my apple - you have two, and I have none. 
We each have an idea. I give you my idea, you give me yours, and then 
we have two ideas each." Intellectual property just doesn't respect 
maths...

Laws (and interpretations of very old laws) are being changed to prop 
up these intangible businesses, and the fundamentally unsound nature 
of the proposition means there are bound to be problems. It's a bit 
like selling air in a can - only now there is no can.

who's ever seen an EULA on a hardware synth?  i haven't.


i could write a program in a few hours that would create sysex files of

could i then copyright these and then demand payment from everyone who
uses that synth with other than the original presets?

I don't know, but this sort of issue is out there all over the place. Not
just in music. (Look at the media today with the labels 'left' and 'right')
People here in the U.S. seem interested, or at least comfortable, aligning
themselves with names of things, and far less interested or comfortable at
just looking or listening and deciding how they feel about someone's work.

I'm trying to get BruteFIR operating in realtime on my 2496.  Currently, however, it fails with the following output:

ALSA I/O: Could not set audio input parameters for "maudio":
  Failed to set channel count to 2: Invalid argument.
Failed to init input device.
Failed to initialise digital audio interfaces.

I get the same message regardless of whether I use the "maudio" pcm defined in my .asoundrc, or "hw", or "hw:0".  I've tried setting channels to 8/0,1 on input, 10/0,1 on output, also with no effect.

My input and output settings for BruteFIR are as follows:

input "left input", "right input" {
	device: "alsa" { param: "maudio"; };
	sample: "S32_LE";
	channels: 2;
};

output "left output", "right output" {
	device: "alsa" { param: "maudio"; };
	sample: "S32_LE";
	channels: 2;
};

And my .asoundrc looks like this:

pcm.maudio {
	type hw;
	card 0;
	device 0;
}

ctl.maudio {
	type hw;
	card 0;
}

pcm.spdif_cap {
	type plug;
	ttable.0.8 1;
	ttable.1.9 1;
	slave.pcm {
		type hw;
		card 0;
		device 0;
	}
}

I'm running the 2.6.0-test5 kernel, and therefore using the ALSA version included.

I'd welcome any suggestions :)

You ought to take a look at that book.  It just looks hard, it's really
pretty easy.  The only tool that's a must is a 6" jointer.  Other tools
- clamps, router, dremel router, surform, drill, sander, jig saw,
straight edge.  Nice to have - band saw, table saw or radial arm saw. 
Absolute must - tons of sandpaper and elbow grease.

Jan,
   I've already happily wasted probably 2 hours going through that web site
and dreaming about doing this. It looks like great fun, but beyond my
abilities...

   I was sort of surprised that this is not really an inexpensive way to get
an instrument put together, compared to buying one. I always sort of assume
that doing it yourself should not be terribly expensive, but in this case
that cost of the parts seems like it could be more expensive. Worth it if
you know how it's going to turn out. Very little resale value for
instruments like this. (I think...)

   Also, to get a Strat body shape, or a Tele body shape, don't you really
need to have the power tools to cut the body wood? Or maybe I could take it
somewhere and pay someone to do that?

   I know nothing about this sort of stuff.

   With all that in mind, how does one who's never done anything like this
take the leap? What's the chance of getting an instrument that stacks up to
the production stuff? I'd do it if I thought I could do something
approaching the quality of an Alembic.

Cheers,
Mark

Actually, I think negativland encourage sampling...

However, I just remembered that Kim Cascone (www.anechoicmedia.com) put out a 
cd called 'Parasites' which had one long track and some 20 short (< 1 min) 
tracks which were intended to be sampled and built into other sound 
structures (just like parasites would evolve/develop).  He even proposed a 
project to the microsound mailing list to do just that.  I even have a piece 
on that (which was done using only linux, yeah!).  You can listen to all 
those pieces here:

probably not likely on the first go-round.
However, assembling a bolt-on guitar from ready-made parts is within
the abilities of anybody who's built a PC :-)
Lots of sources, e.g. http://www.warmoth.com

But yes, DIY guitars are not particularly cheap. Economy of scale is the 
big deal. Consider that a custom hand-made bass from a reputable builder
could easily cost you $3000 to $5000. I'm trying to keep
my project around $1300 and it's going to be tricky.

Mark I fully agree with what you said, and probably the MIS piano is not 
that great compared to those
16 layers samples. But some probably would like to have decent quality 
samples available for free.
And AFAIK there aren't that many around.
Perhaps a music research lab at an university or some private piano 
owner/recording studio that owns the
 required recording equipement could try to make such an 8-16 layer GIG 
file and make it available for
free in order to support the musicians that want to make music with free 
software/sample libraries/sounds.
Of course other instruments are welcome too ;-)
Yes I fully agree it takes lots of work to make a high quality sample 
library but on the other hand
writing a complex audio application takes lots of man-months (of 
talented software engineers which are
 much more rare than musicians/sound designers) so if we follow your 
reasoning one might ask about
why wasting all this time to create for example LinuxSampler when there 
are dozen of sw-samplers
 available on the market. Some powerful cost up to $800-$1000 while 
others run as low as $50-$80
(the german Speedsoft V-Sampler for Windows).
I think the same ideals that induce people to write free audio software 
for Linux should induce sound designers
 that share our beliefs to produce samples and sounds that can be used 
for free.
I think everyone should have the right of making music , and we all know 
instruments (both traditional and electronic ones)
 have always been expensive but thanks to PC technology and free 
software (and hopefully some free samples/sounds)
 we can significantly lower the barrier of entry for the not so wealthy.
Sound designers that make available some of their samples for free will 
contribute to that cause.

I think like there exists the "Digital Divide" (the poor not having 
access to computers/internet),
there exist a "Music Divide" too. (the creative person that would like
to make music but cannot afford to buy the required tools). Let's 
contribute to remove that barrier too.

Now you have a stereo device for channels 22+23, use it like
"aplay -Dplayback_22_23 something.wav". Define some other pcms to be
able to use the other channels at the same time.

To access this from OSS programs, define a pcm named "dsp0":

	pcm.dsp0 {

		slave.pcm playback_22_23
	}

and start your OSS program with the aoss script from the alsa-oss

i forgot that many years ago the shamen's "move any mountain" cd single
had all the different unmixed samples from that song as separate tracks on
the disc.  i was too young then to be able to buy a sampler (and ram was
$50 per megabyte!), and computers weren't used for much more than midi
sequencers.  someone stole that disc before i could do anything with it, 
and i never saw it anywhere again.  reminds me of the time my friend and i 
remixed smothered hope with cool edit - every little change we made took 5 
to 10 minutes, and we went outside everytime to smoke.

Hi,

Anyone knows whether there is any way to decode .ape files in Linux? I believe
there is an xmms plugin lying around somewhere: any other decoder one might
use?

Thanks,

I seem to remember it was available in a triple vinyl version, also 
explicitly intended for remixing. I was lucky enough to see The 
Shamen before Will died.


Last time I used Cool Edit it was no better when it came to opening

<SNIP>


Clemens,
   First, thanks for such clear instructions. That is a big help.

   It turns out that I did not have alsa-oss installed, so I emerged it this
morning. I'm currently running Alsa 0.9.6, primarily due to the HDSP 9652
patches that Thomas did not being in CVS. I got alsa-oss-0.9.6 through
Gentoo this morning. Is that OK? Or do I need 0.9.7 to use this technique?

   Unfortunately, in my first attempt at running this I get a seg fault from
aoss:

mark $ aoss mozilla
/usr/bin/aoss: Line 7:25200 Segmentation fault
LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libaoss.so $*

   Same problem with kmplayer. Do you have some other small app you would
suggest I test this with?

/usr/lib/libaoss.so -> libaoss.so.0.0.0

which does exist and has today's date, so it got built during the emerge.

   I'm remote from the machine right now, so maybe there are some console
messages I would see if I was there. I see nothing in dmesg. I'll look more
closely later today. Maybe it's a typo in the .asoundrc file, or something
stupid I'm doing, so I'll double check everything.

   Again, I just want to give a quick thanks for your help. I'll probably
have a few more questions as I work through this.

cheers,
Mark

i'm finding the same sort of problems on a P3 700 laptop, 256Mb ram....

the one i think we should all check though is 'Traktion', very very nice 
interface and features, i'm product-testing it for my flatmate's book. 
could do with a nice Linux clone - in fact i think this guy has been 
learning things from Linux apps...

Hello all - here's something I'm having a bit of trouble with, I thought
y'all might know (hell it might've been in that huge mp3/ogg thread and I
just missed it)

I need to be able to rip hi res mp3s (320kbs) for submission to certain
liscensing agencies (they insist) - but I haven't been able to figure out
how to do this on my linux box.  I know lame is the main backend - but I had
some kind of trouble a couple weeks back either locating it or finding
detailed info about it or something (I'm gonna go back and do this homework
again), and then of course there's the matter of a front end, which I don't
necessarily care about :) (but I remember not being able to figure out the
proper command line commands or something)

I had much success doing 128kbs mp3s - grip does it, audacity will just
change a wav to an mp3, that's awesome, but they don't seem to deal with
higher resolution than 128 - something made me think it's just not happening
yet in linux and that I need to just rip them on my windows machine...was I
right about this?

I hope I didn't just miss someone talking about this on that long thread :)

This is a little off-topic, but I hope you don't mind.  I get quite a
lot of noise from my soundcard.  There is a pulsing that sounds
something like a very fast morse code at a consistent pitch, and it's
unacceptably loud.  I notice variations in this noise based on how I
move my mouse.

At first I thought this was just because of my shoddy 5-year-old
Soundblaster Live, but I have a new Audiophile 2496 and it does the same
thing.

Today I tried removing the stereo mini plug from my soundcard and
touching it to the metal on my case.  The sound was nearly identical. 
problem is voltage fluctuations in the metal of the case.  Does this
mean my case needs to be grounded somehow?

What can I do to fix this problem?

Josh



-->><<--__-->><<--

Do you hear the same noise with headphones in the Sound Blaster card and
all other outputs/inputs disconnected from all cards?

I suggest that you take your electricity for the computer and amplifier
and all that get's physically connected to them from one grounded outlet.
And beware if you have antennas connected to the system, they give ground
loop humming also.

I have all my vcr, amplifier, cd-player, computer, monitor, etc. taken
from one grounded outlet. So they all should share same ground. Also easy
to plug just one socket out in case of thunder.

Josh,
   Not at all sure about the case grounding part. That's pretty strange.
Maybe your external speakers and your PC are on different power grounds?
Watch out if either is 2-prong. People get killed in the US every year due
to our unsafe power system.

   The mouse part of this is a great example of what happens in some systems
when the sound card IRQ is 'behind' the mouse IRQ, or possibly shared with
the mouse IRQ. The 'IRQ ordering' in a standard PCI (non-SMP, non-IOAPIC)
is:

0,1,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,3,4,5,6,7

(sometimes the #8 is replace by the #2 - don't worry about that.)

Do an lspci to see what IRQ's you mouse and sound card have.

The reason you'd get a noise when you move you mouse is that the mouse
interrupt handler is called, it takes time, and that delays the sound card
doing it's work. This delay empties a buffer or something and that causes a
problem.

A consistent sound could be some other device, like a disk drive, creating
interrupts and your sound card being on a bad IRQ.

If you put a sound blaster on IRQ 5, 6 or, then in my experience I have had
a lot of problems.

This could all be correct and solve your problems, or it could have nothing
to do with your system. ;-)

Hope this helps,
Mark

It appears to be system load based, it might be an internal voltage
interaction when your CPU goes from idle to active.  I've seen
this before.....   try to run this at a bash prompt:
  while true; do yes > /dev/null ; done

Then try your audio, and see how it changes.  The noise might
go away entirely with a non-idle processor.  Try different buffer sizes and see 
if the pitch changes.

Hi all,

New LAU member here. I'm having a problem with terminatorX 3.81 on my Red
hat 8.0 box and Alex (tX author) has suggested upgrading GTK2 to the latest
available version. I've downloaded gtk2, gtk2-devel and gtk-engines from Red
hat's website - but the dependencies are driving me crazy. Does anyone know
a good apt repository with up to date GTK2 packages?

Cheers

- Adam




-->><<--__-->><<--
Thanks for the responses everyone!


No!!  The noise goes away completely (and I get good signal levels)!  Cool.


I tried putting everything on the same power strip and I still get the
noise.  I have a mixer and an amplifier that the signal is going
through, and I get the same noise going:

computer -> mixer -> headphones
computer -> amp -> speakers

as I get going

computer -> mixer -> amp -> speakers


This takes away a large part of the noise.  There is still some noise
that sounds different, and I can still hear my mouse move.  When I move
my mouse vigorously, it starts sounding closer to what it sounds like
when that shell script is not running.

Josh

Self,

 :} I'm not much on fusion... McLaughlin's alright. Most of it just strikes me as too dense, overly complex ...somewhat masturbatory on the part of the artist. It's not always bad... some folk do it well.

 To tell you the truth... I've not actually heard Spocks Beard.


 Sometimes I think the way folk today constantly reference {borrow from} the past is a bit detrimental. ...Keeps them stuck in the past. I always figured the past was something to be learned from and left behind.


 I wonder why folk want to live within labels. Labels are so you can organize you cd collection. Not that I've not adopted a few myself. It's just that... take country, for instance... why do artists tend to drag that whole thing out rather than taking it upon themselves to deviate from it as much as the folk who made "country" {the core folk} managed to deviate from what was around at the time?

 Why are they content with simply mimicking the earlier or defining aspects of whatever movement? Do they actually think that country or metal or punk or whatever else came about that way?

 Back to your point... I like lots of different movements... I may borrow from lots of different movements... no way in hell I'd ever create within or for a specific movement. Why do people do this?


 Your point of view could have used a bit of clarification.


 Technophiles and disco kiddies... :} they're all around us.


 Not exactly. I don't really have a problem with Bush... He's not done all that badly given what he's had to deal with. I think he's gotten a bit hawkish of late. I wouldn't rule out voting for him.








-->><<--__-->><<--

Thanks for the link - sounds wild! One handy feature that I've seen 
some radio stations use is to send the name of the artist and track 
to the gui of the ogg player, xmms in my case. I don't know how 
practical that is with live streams, but it's very handy to know who 
is playing, so you can find them on the web later.

I guess you could even send a URL as part of the meta information, so 
you could launch a browser window automatically and read up on the 
artist as you are listening.

Cheers

It's a blokish magazine, it's true. At least it doesn't have the 
soft-core porn of every other magazine aimed at men these days...

Women do sometimes feature in the magazine as performers, but rarely 
(if ever) as producers or engineers. I did suggest interviewing Wendy 
Carlos once (Switched on Bach, Clockwork Orange soundtrack), but it 
wasn't taken up. I don't know if she counts though, as she was born 
Walter Carlos and did her famous work while still living as a man.

I would have liked to interview Delia Derbyshire (she did the original 
Doctor Who theme for the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, using tape loops) 
but unfortunately she died a few years ago, largely forgotten. At 
least there has now been a BBC Radio 4 play about her life, written 
by Sonic Boom from Spacemen 3 I think.

I guess the Audiophile is more tricky to get headphoned.. (I have it too)


Then you should have all the equipment physically connected to each other
from their cases, like grounding them together. ** BUT BEWARE, THIS MIGHT
BE DANGEROUS. ** I don't know where you live, but in Finland the
electricity system is pretty darn safe and I wouldn't have any hesitations
to do so. There might be high voltage differences between the cases, so
all equipment should be disconnected from the outlet before grounding them
together. And take life insurance first :) And don't sue me if something
blows :)

Previously I had my gear in non grounded outlet and found out that the
voltage difference between my aplifier and computer case was around 240V,
but only for a fraction of a second because they got grounded together as
soon as they got physically connected throuhg the voltmeter. Of course
the current was not much so it was not lethal, but gave some nice snaps at
your fingers if you touched both. Then I got a grounded outlet and the
problem disappeared.

Unfortunately my aplifier doesn't have a grounded electricity plug, so it
still grounds through my cables, but the common ground is now same as the
real ground, which was not the case previously when the common ground was
'floating'.

BUT, if I have my vcr and radio connected to the amplifier, I hear
the humming noise at high volume levels. It doesn't bother in low volumes,
but if I were to record something, I'd plug out the antennas first. No
antennas -> completely silence.


Just make sure that all that connects to your computer (usb stuff,
firewire, monitor, etc.) don't cause the noise. Try plugging out all of
them.


Try different PCI slot. But my guess for the mouse noise is the graphics
adapter. I remember in the old days with SBPro, that I had to choose ISA
slot that had the most distance to the graphics adapter, and still get
some high pitch whining. If it was closer, it got louder.

Do you have some motherboard integrated thingy or some real AGP card?

Tommi

ps. Currently my amplifier is at recording studio and all I have is this
crappy portable cd-cassette-radio boombox. It has only mic input with
a 3,5mm miniplug. It gives me high whining noise and I can hear only the
left channel. And I'm ought to do some drum track editing due monday.. :(

Talking about Mandrake. After having postponed my testdrive of Mandrake as DAW 
a couple of weeks ago in the wait for 9.2, You told me that 9.2 wuld come 
with ardour, but as far as I can see they are only in contrib (and ardour is

another reposotory somewhere?

The contrib stuff in Mandrake is pretty well integrated using urpmi

SuSE included it on the 8.1 CDs but then dropped it again from 8.2.

SuSE tend to bundle a lot of stuff, much of which doesn't really
work yet or hasn't been well packaged -- I think at least one of
those was probably the case here.


Chris




-->><<--__-->><<--

Personally, I'd rather have a distro on 1 CD of well tested and 
integrated stuff than 7 CD's of random binaries. Quality, not 
quantity is the key, because we're basically up against OS X and 
Windows XP, and you get very little extra software as standard with 
those OS's. So it's easy for a Linux distro to look untested and 
poorly integrated by comparison. 

At the time of SuSE 8.1, I think Paul Davis was specifically asking 
people not to distribute binaries, which is fair enough. 
 
Cheers

Daniel



-->><<--__-->><<--

Actually I'd quite like 1 CD of well tested and integrated stuff
plus 6 CDs of random binaries, and that's pretty much what you
get with SuSE.  I'm less keen on it now I have a broadband
connection, but it was a very good choice when I used a modem.


Yep.


Chris

I've failed the test so far:

1) My Windows box at work doesn't stream ogg. foobar2000 doesn't seem to

2) My Gentoo box doesn't seem to be set up inside of Mozilla to stream ogg.

Bummer.

- Mark





-->><<--__-->><<--

Yes, all the good audio stuff is in contrib.  I'm sure I pointed that
out in the HowTo.  Beta3 was the latest version when 9.2 development was
frozen, so that's what went in.  Thac's RPM of beta5 should work fine,
although I don't think there's much difference between the two
versions.  I think we'll all be a lot happier when ardour 1.0 is
released.

Just because you are plugged into a three prong outlet doesn't mean it's grounded. Sometimes when electrical outlets are wired, the ground connection isn't actually grounded and is useless. Sometimes power strips have a little light on it to show if it is actually grounded or not. Also, cheap power conditioners can help alot. (Rack Rider for instance)




-->><<--__-->><<--

There's a lot of info available on proper grounding techniques.
E.g. there's some here:

Hallo,


There is a schedule page on the site, but this would be handy, I
agree.


Make sure, you configure a proxy, if you must do that. Also ogg
streaming was broken until foo2k 0.7. But it should work now.


No kidding, but: You could try "wget" instead. I used that yesterday,
because I wanted to grab the concert to a file as well. Just wget the
URL and listen to the constantly growing ogg file. 

You also can input the ogg stream URl directly into xmms or
alsaplayer. With alsaplayer this is a bit strange, because you need to
copy the URL to the File->Open dialog instead of a file. If it starts
with "http://..." it will stream instead of looking for a file. Last
but not least ogg123 should support streaming, too.

Sorry about this extremely naive question, but since this is my first time 
trying to get linux to be a DAW I stumble onto some problems of course. And 
my know-how is somewhat limited unfortunately.

My staudio c-port (envy 24 based 8 channel card analogue + 2 channel digital 
from www.staudio.com with built in midi-interface) works as far as audio goes 
now, but I can't seem to get anything out of the midiports even though it 
seems to be properly recognized. Alsa Patch bay gives me a: Rawmidi: 0 - 
Hoontech SoundTrack Audio DSP24 MPU-401 entry at least (actually 2 - one for 
each midi port), but no matter which I choose in rosegarden or any other app, 
I get no signal in the displays. How do I find out if it's working, and how 
do I troubleshoot. If this is well documented somewhere and comprehensible 
for semidummies, I'd be happy to receive a link!

Best regards
Ketil



-->><<--__-->><<--

For now, add this to your .bashrc:
alias ladccad='ladccad -d /home/ketil/audio-projects'

and you will not have the problem anymore.

I have fixed this in future rpms.

Seems as if your question is not so naive. I have exactly the same
problem, that is, midi not working, and I remember earlier postings with
this question, but no answers. I have posted a similar question to the

the midi driver is not working properly.

A nice trick when talking about midi into the computer is "cat dev"
where dev is the device in question. With my setup it would be
/dev/snd/midiC1D0 (Card 1, Device 1), but maybe you should start with
either /dev/midi00 or /dev/midi01 or /dev/midi0 or something like that.

i was quite surprised to see that the command-line ape decoder seems to
run fine under wine. Mac.exe appears to be selfcontained. I had to
copy this from an MS machine as the Ape installer didnt work.

i'm using this relatively untested script.
Maybe others will find it useful....?

A question from a newbie:
I have a Soundbalster mp3+ usb sound card attached to my HP laptop running
Redhat 9. It works great and I was amazed at how easy it was to get it
going, worth a look for those after a USB sound card.

However I have discovered problems when I record with it. Any recording I
make is full of little skips, more skips if I record at higher qualities.
I am using sox to both play and record.

Any insights?

My experience with SuSE 8.1 is that it does a good job at installing and 
usually delivers what it claims. It's just that the apps tend to be old 
versions. And it funny that You mentioned Ardour because it's the only 
one (that comes to mind) that I remember having problems installing. 
That doesn't mean that there hasn't been problems with how well the apps 
are that are included with SuSE 8.1, it just means that I can't (recall) 
having problems with installing or running any other apps. Actually, I 
find that the dependencies and installations are pretty good. Like I 
said, the only thing I can say bad is how old some of the apps are 
though. But all that is needed to run the programs are there and do 
(tend) to install without a hitch. At least they do with SuSE 8.1.

Hi Tim,

Both the APE source code and statically linked Linux binaries
are available at:

 http://www.personal.uni-jena.de/~pfk/MPP/index2.html#ape

I have only used it for decoding (transcoding to FLAC).

Hello!

Like the subject line says, I'm a newcomer, this is my first post on 
this list. So, hiyall =) Also, forgive my faulty English. (and the long 
rant, possibly even a bit OT too)

When I found Shaketracker I was bouncing with the joy, until I tried to 
compile it. There aren't so many good music apps for linux and 
especially not too many tracker-like midi apps. I really like the 
tracker UI but I can't seem to find good 'classical' 
instruments(samples) for trackers. I have good midi instruments, but I 
dearly hate the input system almost all midi composing tools have 
adopted. So Shaketracker was what I had been looking for some time... 
and like I said, I couldn't get it to compile.

At this point I didn't try to fix it myself, because usually with some 
googling you'll find out someone else has made a patch or there is 
actually a new version of the software which compiles etc. So, after 
googling, I had only found other people who had the same problems. I 
took a hammer and began fixing it myself with not-so-optimistic 
feelings.

I got it working though, it was mostly namespace problems, some code 
changes here and there. I still gives warnings but compiles and 
runs(works) on my RedHat 9.0 system. So, someone still struggling with 
this problem, I have got a patch for you to try out =)

Hallo,


I would love to download your patch. I would love it even more, if it
was incorporated into the shaketracker distribution proper, so that
Shaketracker finally can become C++ standard compliant again.

Heya,


The patch is available here:

http://www.cc.jyu.fi/~savu/stgcc3.patch

The patch is done against Shaketracker 0.4.6. If you use it in 
Shaketracker's directory, please use patch with -p1 parameter. I'm not a 
c++ guru so this may be far from optimal(the hash_map thing isn't as 
beautiful as it could be :). I'm open to comments. Most of all, I hope 
it works for you =)

Greetings:

  I've been working with Tim Thompson's KeyKit, trying to get it to send 
its output to a softsynth. I can set a variable for KeyKit that will 
select the ALSA rawmidi device with this syntax :

        export ALSA_RAWMIDI_DEVICE=hw:1,0

where hw:1,0 refers to my card1 (the ALSA virmidi module) and its first 
device (0). Now when I start KK (and set the Port Enabler to ALSA) I can 
route its output to whatever connections are available via aconnect (or 
the kaconnect GUI).

  I just wanted to say "Thanks!" to the ALSA developers for the virmidi 
module. I've used it with MIDI sequencers running under emulation 
systems such as DOSemu and Xsteem, I've used it for the TK707 virtual 
drum machine, and now I'm using it with KeyKit. The combination of 
TiMidity-as-softsynth (with the Fluid soundfont) and the virmidi module 
is a very powerful and flexible system for me, and I just wanted to pass 
on a note of appreciation for the ALSA team's work.

  Okay, that's all. We now return to our regularly scheduled programming...

Best regards,

Frank,
   Hi. I'm setting up my system to try and listen to some of this later
today. I did figure out, or think I did, how to get alsaplayer to
apparently load and play the ogg stream. Thanks to who ever wrote how to
do that. (I no longer have the email.)

   Does this stream run all the time, and music only plays during the
scheduled times? Right now I'm getting a noise signal of about -38db,
according to hdspmixer. No audio, which is expected, but I do get this
digital noise right now.

   So, I believe there is a 9 hour difference between California and
Paris, so I guess I check back again around 11AM here to see if this is
working. I'm looking forward to this!

Thanks,
Mark

Hallo,


Use ecasound instead. Use double buffering ("-z:db,dbsize"), maybe 
realtime mode ("-r"). Also you might want to install a low-latency
kernel, which should give less skipping when running in realtime mode.

Hi people.

I don't think it is common knowledge that www.archive.org has an extensive 
amount of live recordings stored that can be freely listened to! 
Some great stuff there, only problem is that most stuff is stored as Shorten 
files. It gives very good sound quality since shorten is a non destructive 
compression format, but it sure gives my broadband connection a beating!

Just go to:
http://www.archive.org/audio

Just recently I noticed that they have a added subsection called 
"Open Source Audio" which seems to be open for any kind of recording. 

Looks like this could become a great place for sharing music / sounds.

Hallo,


Yes, it works for me, thanks a lot. Feels good to be able to use
shaketracker again. I compiled it on Debian with g++-3.3. The only
problem, but this seems to be a Debian bug, is, that I had to remove
all "extern "C" void exit..." lines from configure, because otherwise
it would fail at looking for libgtk--. I already filed a bug report
regaring this to the Debian BTS.

Audacity has a setup to choose what bit rate you wasnt on exported MP3s.
(That's Audacity 1.0.1)

If yours can make MP3s you've probably got lame installed already, because
Audacity calls for external help to do MP3 encoding (and that's usually

Hello. Regarding the recent discussion, would anyone else be
interested in creating a free sound library? Both the instrumental
sounds and the sound effects.

How to organize such a project? From my experience the most
difficult part is in getting the equipment together. We need to
match the people who have the equipment (or money) and the people
who are willing to record the sounds. (I'm only in the second group,
unfortunately.)

We need
 -Microphone
 -Portable recorder and/or a sound-proof recording studio
 -Music instruments

Microphone could be of any quality if that is only what we have.
The portable recorder as well need not be a quality device if
that is all we have. This is so because it is better to get the
project started now.

I have a cheap stereo microphone. Anyone could borrow me a portable
MiniDisc recorder? Anything which has stereo microphone input?

We need recording guides for how and what to record. I have already
sound effect catalogs of Sound Ideas so the "what" should not be
a problem. We archive the raw recordings even for the instrument
sounds, because different group of people can then make proper synth
sound files out of the raw recordings. For sound effects we take
the modern approach by assuming that the effects can be postprocessed:
for example, we don't arrange and mix "horses, men, swords, fighting"
sound effects, but instead, we assume the end-users are cabable of
arranging the fight scenes theirself. Similarly we assume the end-users
have full environmental acoustics processing tools: for example,
a passing car can be made with doppler and suitable acoustics.

So, with the sound library we could provide a 3D geometry editing
software with 3D acoustics: 3D scene + animation.

Best regards,
Juhana



-->><<--__-->><<--

Ah, so they changed the status already? Very interesting. "Untested"
means "Completely unsupported", right? This is very bad news, and seeing
this, I doubt that there is any chance to have a fully working DSP2000C
within reasonable time.

For me, there is no other choice than switching back to Win =B498 and
Cubase VST and forgetting completely about sound under Linux, at least
for now.

Does anyone know how to get RoseGarden4 and Ardour 0.9beta5 to play nicely?  I 
thought that's why they added the JACK master/transport master function in 
Beta5 and I'd really like to have both of them synced.

What I'm trying to do is not unlike using SMPTE have Rosegarden act as a slave 
and Rosegarden to be the master.

Here's what I do:

1) Fire up Jack using QjackCTL
2) Load Ardour
3) Load Rosegarden

I create a sequence in Rosegarden.  Then nothing happens. :)

I've gotten this far, but I can't get Ardour in Sync with Rosegarden when I 
press play in Ardour, rosegarden isn't "chasing" or locking onto sync.  I'm 
trying to capture my sampler which is inputted to my Delta card and have the 
MIDI/Audio in sync.  and no, I haven't been using MTC either.. 

I've noticed there is a Start|Pause feature in the qjackctl front end for 
JackD but It doesn't seem to have any effect.

Is this configuring possible, or am I mistaken and just misinterpreting what 
the terminologies mean?  If it's in fact just ardour and/or rosegarden has 
anyone been successful in syncing a MIDI sequencer and multi-track audio 
editor (MUSE/Audacity perhaps?)

Regards,
Chris



-->><<--__-->><<--

If your speakers are connected via the line out on the soundcard, then 
the audio must be being captured from line in unless you have 
hardware monitoring features (often called 'zero latency 
monitoring').

If that's not the case (ie you are not routing the speakers through 
the soundcard) and assuming your soundcard is fully supported by the 
installed driver and is set up correctly, it sounds to me like you 
haven't got your mixer set to the right channel for recording from 
line in.

If you have ALSA drivers installed, try running alsamixer and see 
which channel is set for 'capture'. If you have OSS drivers, try 
aumix or kmix.

If that fails then I would go back and check that your soundcard is 
fully supported by the driver, then try some setup tests.
 
Cheers

Daniel



-->><<--__-->><<--

We had a discussion on this list about this issue recently. Basically, 
it's all on the shoulders of one guy to keep it up to date, and that 
isn't really fair. I'd like to see the ALSA status page become more 
wiki-like so we can all contribute in keeping it up to date. All the 
distributions seem to use it as the definitive reference, even though 
it isn't.

There's also the opportunity to raise some funds for the project by 
organising the information to recommend the best equipment, in terms 
of best compatibility and driver support. Since soundcards are a 
relatively high-ticket item (compared to CDs or books, say) the 
referral fees from on-line retailers should make it worthwhile.

Hi

I'm working on some soundfonts in swami, but it's frustrating that
there's no sample editing features in there. Basically what I need is
simply to removed portions of the sample. This is not possible from
within swami, right?

Next solution would be to process the samples in some other program, but
then it would be nice to be able to setup sample points here that were
imported into swami. Is that possible, and if so with which program?

Thanks in advance...

Ardour beta5 has transport and timebase master working, but the "synch

about that, he said it would take a "small amount of code".


That starts and stops the transport.  To have a visible effect you
need clients that will synch to the JACK transport.


I don't know of any general MIDI sequencer that has released JACK
transport support yet.  Here is the current status AFAIK...

   rosegarden -- developers have expressed interest, but they need to
   fold that back into their own release plans and schedules

   MUSE -- I have not heard any plans

   ardour -- has partial support in beta5 (master, not slave)

   ecasound -- has a full implementation of both master and slave

   audacity -- if it has JACK support of any kind I haven't heard
   about it

   hydrogen -- has JACK transport support in the latest release

I would be interested to hear about others, and to receive corrections
for any misunderstandings on my part.

- of course the card is the HDSP9652 - I don't know if that would be 
different, I guess not but I don't know for sure)

well thanks in advance!

As I understand it, Portaudio v19 (which is currently available within

have native ALSA and JACK support. So things are moving in the right 
direction.

There is a test application which shows all received events in the
alsa-lib source package. Go to the alsa-lib/test/ directory, run
"make seq", then call it like "./seq decoder 64.0", where 64.0 is the
client/port number (you have to use a point instead of the usual colon
here).

However, MIDI input on that card is broken AFAIK.


Regards,
Clemens





-->><<--__-->><<--

This isn't a PCM definition, it's a RawMIDI definition (which happens
to have the same name). All ALSA devices implemented in the kernel are
accessed by a plugin named "hw". See /usr/share/alsa/conf/alsa.conf
for the various definitions (pcm, ctl, rawmidi, seq, hwdep, timer).

It's possible to give some rawmidi port its own name, just like pcms:

	rawmidi.my_virtual {
		type hw
		card 1
		device 0
	}

then you could use my_virtual instead of hw:1,0.


Another useful plugin (the only other currently available
rawmidi plugin) is the virtual rawmidi device, which is implemented in
user space and doesn't need the snd-virmidi kernel driver.

If you use "virtual" instead of "hw:1,0", each application using this
will create a virtual sequencer port on the fly. (This may not be what
you want, because each application instance will create a seperate
virtual device, and the port exists only as long as the application is
running).

It's as up to date as the reports of either the developers or the users 
so someone must have got the driver working.

It would be helpful if you could send some status info eg

cat /proc/asound/xxx

What are your settings in the modules.conf file? The developers will no 
doubt be interested if there is a midi bug for this device.

Hi there !

I have a question concerning vst plugins/instruments
under linux.

I would like to use vst/plugins/instruments lets say
absynth under linux and being controlled by pure data.

I wonder if someone has tried a setup like that.

Is it better to run vstserver or to run cubasesx under
wine and within that the vst-plugins/instruments ???

Does someone have a cubasesx running under wine with
vst instruments inside ??? How do i communicate with
pd ?? Through midi-audio /JACK-connction ???

The howto i found

http://www.djcj.org/LAU/quicktoots/toots/vst-plugins/

is a little bit too superficial (at least for me since
i am not such a linux expert) , Is there anything more
in depth - including all the steps for wine etc ???


Thanks in advance

Humm...this only seems to work if your sound card uses i/o mapping. The H=

Hi,

running debian sid with a 2.4.18 kernel and alsa 0.9.5, I think.
Folks on this list and alsa-user helped me get alsa working with my
onboard sound, via vt8233, about a year ago.  It works ok, but I've
got 1 problem and one question.


PROBLEM: every once in a while -- not often -- sound will hang and
bring the whole system down; this happens with xmms, alsaplayer, and
zinf, so I don't think it's strictly the playback software's fault.
usually this isn't a catastrophe, since this is a workstation, not a
heavy-duty server, but I'd like it not to happen.  Anyone see this
behaviour before, or know how I should try to diagnose it?  

QUESTION: My sound card has three analog outs (green, blue, pink).  I
gues sthese are for a 5.1 surround sound system or something, but I'd
like to try to have one stereo out go to my cheapo speakers, and one
go to my headphones.  Unfortunately I'm unable to get a signal out of
anything other than the pink out.  The others just give static and
wierd stuff, even with all the outputs turned up in alsamixer.  Anyone
know if it's possible to set this up the way I want?  Even general
hints abbout how 5.1 systems work would probably be really helpful.

thanks loads,

Hallo,

...

Well, this is a bit strange. I'm guessing a bit now: 

The offending lines in your example result from adriver.h defining
things for some kernel versions, including kernel 2.4.22.

For example the error regarding PDE: 

/home/ric/alsa-driver-0.9.7c/include/adriver.h:134: error:
redefinition of `PDE
'/lib/modules/2.4.22-1.2097.nptl/build/include/linux/proc_fs.h:17:
error: `PDE' previously defined here

This means, that somewhere in "include/linux/proc_fs.h" the name PDE
is already defined. In adriver.h ALSA tries to define it on its own
like this: 

#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE < KERNEL_VERSION(2, 5, 4)
#include <linux/fs.h>
static inline struct proc_dir_entry *PDE(const struct inode *inode)
{
...
#endif

The strange thing is, that in my rather vanilla version of kernel
2.4.22 there is no such thing as PDE in include/linux/*: 

$ grep PDE /usr/src/linux/include/linux/proc_fs*
$    (nothing here)

So I suspect, but I can only guess here, that your kernel source has a
patch that introduces this PDE thing (I have no idea what it could be
used for).

I don't know if ALSA could fix that at all. It might be, that if
Fedora ships a custom Linux kernel source, they should also provide
adapted ALSA-sources.

Richard,

For me it looks like your kernel has
ALSA included into source tree already.

It is only a guess  -- I dont have
a lny linux in hands right now
but you can check
it with something like:

find /usr/src/linux/ | xargs grep -sqi alsa && echo yes I have ALSA in kernel

NB: i haven't try this  but should work

If You're suggesting that "smurf" wont edit a sample because "swami" 
doesn't (because smurf is an earlier version of swami), then I can't 
agree with that. I started using smurf because (whatever version) of 
swami  (that I was using at that time) wouldn't let Me do something that 
I wanted to do (I can't remember what it was that I was attempting to 
do) but smurf would let me do whatever it was that I was attempting to do.

Whatever smurf allowed Me to do (that swami wouldn't) was important. I 
think it had to do with loading or saving a sound font. So, if I'm not 
mistaken about that, then it's not so hard to beleive that smurf will 
allow for a sample to be edited.

BTW.. I use smurf Version 0.52.6

I've had this happen to me twice...

The first time it was a bad sound card. I know because it was making 
static sounds. But the proof was that My sister installed it in Her 
Windows Machine and it caused problems that She didn't have prior. We 
thew it away and both of our computers had no more problems... Until...

The second time I had this problem, it was caused by a bad speaker wire. 
I noticed that the computer would freeze up when I would unplug the 
speaker (to plug in the headphones). That's the only time I had the 
freeze up. So I use a different set of speakers (and change from speaker 
to headphones all the time) and have no more problems with freeze ups.


I know that I was getting static sounds with the soundcard that ended up 
freezing up my computer.

I think Red Hat have publically stated that what used to be the stable 
distribution will now be a test bed for the Enterprise distros, 
breaking compatibility on a regular basis.  From my point of view, I 
don't want to be an alpha tester all the time - there's enough to 
keep track of in Linux audio as it is.

I regard the situation as unfortunate, because I think stable, free 
as-in-beer distributions that can be installed and used by the 
average person are important. The number of distributions that meet 
this criteria seems to be shrinking, not growing. Red Hat and SUSE 
have become the new proprietary UNIX with 'enterprise' pricing, 
Debian and Gentoo (and to a lesser extent Slackware) retain their 
tech elitism - and then there's Lindows, Lycoris, Xandros, Libranet 
etc competing for the pay-to-play market. 

At least Mandrake is still interested in taking free software to the 
general public, and dyne:bolic has that vibe which I suspect got most 
of us interested in Linux audio in the first place.

On this workstation here at work I never log out from Monday morning to

sounds like your alsa drivers are getting autocleaned maybe

Caveat: if alsaconf succeded in configuring your soundcard and you want 
your sound modules to stay loaded at all times add these couple of lines 
at the very end of the /etc/modules.conf file that was changed by alsaconf:

# -- Keep modules from being autocleaned
add options -k snd-card-0

RedHat has an autoclean process that runs every 10 minutes and removes 
kernel modules that have not been used for a while.

An alternative (sexier?) method would be to configure kmod to save
configuration information and reload it.  Appending this to
modules.conf should work:

pre-remove snd snd-ice1712 alsactl store
post-install snd-ice1712 alsactl restore

Replace snd-ice1712 above with whatever the name of your particular
sound modules is, and you should be set.

Indeed the driver built.

The folowing is a bit more machine specific and im not 
sure how to fix this at all.. 
Not for a lack of cards , i decided to use the onboard 
network adapter and sound card.With that setup ,i do the alsaconf.
the /etc/modules.conf is written .. all looks good and when i reboot 
disaster strikes.The network is gone.
I have no idea what's going on.But everytime alsa is installed
im loosing the hardware  eth0.

This is a SiS K7S5A Pro mobo with Athlon 1800 CPU
Now i could always try and throw in a network card ( got tons) 
but id rather use the onboard if possible.

Any ideas what's going on ?

Hi Sasha,

there seems to be several problems here.

1. starting muse w/o jack

2. starting jack with sudo, with -d hw:0

3. starting jack without -d hw:0

-----
Number 3 would probably work better if you added the -d hw:0

Number 2... I've never tried to sudo it, try as "normal" root. Though the 
errors you get may suggest that there is something wrong with your 
soundcard-setup.

Number 1... well, the data printed suggests your card is severely 
misconfigured... I have no good clues to what may be the problem.

What is in your /etc/modules.conf?

What other programs have you gotten to work that proves that audio works?

/Robert

well the good news is that absynth does seem to work
in pd :-)


run vstserver.


As vstserver is quite new, its not well packaged and the setup 
is quite lengthy. Pd also has a learning curve, but its quite
a powerful tool and you will not be wasting your time.

there isnt usually much to do for wine. As a mature
package it is well supported by most distros.
eg urpmi wine
   emerge wine
   etc...
you might have to tweak ~/.wine/config slightly.
check installation by typing "wine notepad" or similar.

so which distro are you using and how far have you got so far?


cheers!

Hi all,

Does anyone know if it's possible, under linux, to turn  a good quality audio 
recording into a file that sounds like an old vinyl record.  Any ideas?  
Realtime and non-realtime will be equally useful.

First: Using an equalizer, kill all frequencies below ~600 and above ~2k. Use a graphic EQ for this. (The two values are just examples, you can play with both frequencies to get the desired sound you're looking for.)

Second: get a recording of the inside blank track that comes after the last song of a noisy record. Loop this noise and mix it over top of the song once you've done the band pass filter from step one.

That's a bit drastic for vinyl - more like an acoustically recorded
78rpm from about 1920. Those were pressed on shellac, not vinyl.

The priciple's about the same, though - add a few random background
ticks and clicks, a bit of white noise as many vinyl discs had tape
noise from the master, possibly a bit of distortion on peaks if you want
it to sound like a worn record/stylus, and also some gentle frequency
variation at 0.5 Hz (for 33 1/3 rpm) to simulate a less-than perfect
turntable or warped record.

I'm sure it can be done with Linux tools...

I'd say its all possible with audacity:
http://audacity.sourceforge.net
Its  an Multitrack-able Wave/Mp3/OGG-manipulation tool with LADSPA-support, I think. Anyway, there are a lot of "integrated plugins" that allows what you want to do. A real PROGRAMM can do what you want is not written, I think ... ;)

Hi!

I am the guy with the alsa problem you remember me ? Well, I recompiled alsa, this time without any unresolved symbols... . Don't work right, but I installed a second card from which I know that it worked well, but this card cannot output something ( the hardware-outport is broken [ ooups ] )... .
This is my modules.conf:
alias char-major-116 snd
alias snd-card-0 snd-ens1371
alias snd-card-1 snd-es1938
alias char-major-14 soundcore
alias sound-slot-0 snd-card-0
alias sound-slot-1 snd-card-1
# Es1371
#alias sound-service-0-0 snd-mixer-oss
#alias sound-service-0-1 snd-seq-oss
#alias sound-service-0-3 snd-pcm-oss
#alias sound-service-0-8 snd-seq-oss
#alias sound-service-0-12 snd-pcm-oss
# ESS-Solo1
alias sound-service-1-0 snd-mixer-oss
alias sound-service-1-1 snd-seq-oss
alias sound-service-1-3 snd-pcm-oss
alias sound-service-1-8 snd-seq-oss
alias sound-service-1-12 snd-pcm-oss
#
options snd major=116 cards_limit=2
options snd-ens1371 index=0
options snd-es1938 index=1
----
Everything seems to work fine, except that alsa uses my broken card, the ES1371 for audio output.
If I set jack to Playback via the card with index 1 , so my ESS-Solo1 (snd-es1938):
# jackd -d alsa -d hw:0 -P hw:1
Jack just prints out the helpscreen, and if you have a look by yourself:
...
    -P,--playback [name]        playback output and optionally set the playback device (default: duplex)
...
[name] can be "optionally set (to) the playback device", in my case hw:1, so my second card with card index 1, see modules.conf. Why this jack-error ? And any idea why sound-output is not piped by alsa generally ?? 

Thx for attention

Sascha Retzki




-->><<--__-->><<--

What exactly doesn't work?


How do you know this?


Do you mean the card is physically broken?
Do you get error messages when you try to use it?
Have you used a program such as alsamixer to bring up the volume level, which defaults to all the way off?


What is "everything"?  You just said the first card didn't work right, and the second card had no output.


If I understand ALSA correctly, this is because it is the default device -hw:0.  I think you would need to explicitly tell ALSA to use a different device.  Have you read up on .asoundrc files?  (I haven't (I know I ought to) - but I think it might be the answer).


Why do you say "-d hw:0" if you want it to use hw:1?  Try this:

jackd -d alsa -d hw:1

Good luck :)

LOL, hi !
I see that it is  "irresponsible" to post a msg begins with 'you know iam the guy xy, I had x problem' ... .

Well:
I have had several problems with my ESS-Solo1 soundcard to start various sound apps which 
using jack ... . The second card, the Es1371, IS able to start jack, the esssolo1 quits with some alsa-error msgs. I first thought the esssolo1-problem is a symbol-problem in the alsa-modules, but a recompilation ( a successfull ) did not change something with the "support" of the esssolo1 with jack.
So my Ess-Solo1 cannot be used via jack. My second card, Es1371, can , but it is physically broken. just the output-port, so this little "whole" where I put the speakers in, you understand ? I want to pipe jack-output to my first card, the Ess-Solo1. So I want to use my Es1371 for my MiDI-keyboard, for capturing AND for STARTING various soundapps like muse,ardour and Rosegarden4 and so on, but let the Ess-Solo1 output all the stuff jackd gets. (*puh* )


So, my cards are NOW:
Ess-solo1 	<->	hw:0
Es1371	<-> hw:1

# jackd -d alsa -d hw:1 -P hw:0

Should set jack to USE the hw:1, so Es1371 and output via hw:0, my Ess-Solo1, right ? I think thats the question of my originally mail ;)  . Sry, but I exchanged the order of both cards, I think in my first mail Ess-solo1 was hw:1 , but this is not good. You pointed it: My ess-solo1 is my normal sound-card for listening to music and so on, and it should be the first alsa card.
So, the above command prints out the help-menue which u get via:

# jackd -d alsa --help

Why ?

greetz, Sascha Retzki




-->><<--__-->><<--

No. It tells jackd to use hw:1. The hw:0 at the end of your command line is
meaningless to jackd.

i think you have to write a special .asoundrc to accomplish what you want.
I don't know.

Speaking of Creative Commons, did any of you see the major article in, of
all places, The Wall Street Journal last week about Creative Commons and a
new CD being released under that license. A name brand Brazilian artist who
expects his work to be sampled and used to make more music. The article
covered a good portion of two pages.

I think there was a bit of a conversation here a few weeks ago about this
sort of thing, and maybe some Residents CD?

Anyway, WSJ, now an interesting place to read about new happenings in music!

That's pretty harsh.
Recent vinyl records actually have a pretty good frequency response.


It's actually the dust motes that contribute the most to the "vinyl
feel". It should be fun to simulate that, actually.
Should be like... lemme see... white noise shot through narrow and tall
envelopes. Pretty much like the attack phase of the piano sound, except
that the parameters are different (hence it sounds more like "plastic"
than "metal").

Hallo,


There is no "that license" and this is also what I don't like about
Creavtive Commons. There is a whole bunch of CC licenses and some of
these I wouldn't even consider "free".

For example there is a CC license that forbids commercial
distribution. Such things would go to non-free in Debian.

Change:

to:
<!DOCTYPE UI><UI version="3.1.2" stdsetdef="1">

It worked for me. I think it's because the .ui-files are generated with a 
newer version of qt-designer. I haven't tested it thoroughly though, but if 
compilation works it's unlikely they have features that is 3.2 only. ;-)

yes

But freshrpms.net works pretty damn well, and PlanetCCRMA all the same,
and the installation process is very simple.


Recent discussions on the Red Hat development forums have pointed out
that, since 2.6 will certainly include ALSA, then that functionality
will automagically appear in RH once the kernel version will be bumped
up. Which it only makes sense, if you think of it.

That being said, i've been a happy user of the Freshrpms.net packages
for a long time. If Fedora doesn't do anything about it, and if Matthias
or someone else doesn't step up as the ALSA maintained for Fedora, then
i'll do it (as well as for Xine, transcode, dvdauthor and other things
i'm using on a daily basis).

Hallo,


Thanks for that information. I also found and recommended to try the
packages from freshrpms. Glad that they do indeed work (couldn't
really test them myself, as I use Debian).


Well, I think it would have been an advantage for RH if ALSA had been
included as an option prior to 2.6.  ALSA is not only the kernel
modules, instead libasound and the alsa-utils are an integral part in
getting an ALSA based system to work. As a distributor Redhat sooner
or later will have to (or want to) provide configuration tools that
fit into their own system. Redhat cannot get away with just compiling 
another set of sound modules. ALSA apps are needed as well as another
documentation.

All these things can be quite tricky, if you leave the
linux-audio-user|dev and try to reach the wider target audience of a
general distribution like Redhat or Suse. 

But I'm glad to hear that Redhat will probably go ALSA with 2.6 (I
feard that the would still have gone the OSS path). I'm confident,
that this will be quite a push for ALSA support in applications.

Hi all, I've tried contacting the maintainer of the project (Andy), but
he never bothered to reply, so now I am taking this question to all of
you out there that might have had exposure to this interesting library.
Does anyone know what is the current status of the whole project anyhow?
Any help on this matter is greatly appreciated! When answering any of
the given questions, please include the question in your reply. Thank
you very much! 

So here's the excerpt from the letter:

I've recently decided to incorporate libalsaplayer-like functionality
the upcoming version of my app RTMix. However, with having a particular
feature in mind I am wondering whether libalsaplayer provides that and
if not, whether you'd be willing to add it (or let me add it, although
that might get messy since I am not too familiar with the inner workings
of the lib). So, here it goes:

Apart from all the wonderful features libalsaplayer offers, I am looking
for some additional ones:

I would like to be able to indefinitely loop specific "ranges" of a
particular soundfile (i.e. 2.2secs-4.12secs or whatever).

1. Is it possible to do this and have music continually loop even if one
changes the direction of playing so that when the alsaplayer runs out of
the looping material in each direction that it just jumps back onto the
other end of the loop and contiues on (kind of like a ring-buffer)?

2. Is it also possible to do this kind of looping on the whole soundfile
(the gui version of alsaplayer always stops if I let it play 'til the
end or the beginning, depending in which direction I am going).

3. Is it possible to define loop points by addressing a particular
sample number rather than giving time in seconds?

4. How stable is alsaplayer when looping really small chunks of sound
(i.e. like 5 sample loop)?

5. Is alsaplayer capable of ramping such loop points by attenuating
let's say ending 20 samples (it would be cool if this number could be
user-selectable) and then ramping up the beginning 20 samples in order
to alleviate the "pop" that happens when looping a sound where waveforms
at the beginning and the end do not align?

6. If the feature in question 5 does not exist is there a way to control
output level of a player on a per-sample basis via callback so that one
can implement that outside of the lib?

7. If neither 5 or 6 are possible, would you be willing to implement
such functionality (i.e. a toggle_ramp( bool ); and set_ramp_length( int
); callbacks or something similar.

I would greatly appreciate your feedback on this matter as that will
greatly assist me in determining how to go about implementing such
functionality in my app.

Thank you very much! Looking forward to hearing from you. Sincerely,

Ivica Ico Bukvic, composer & multimedia sculptor
http://meowing.ccm.uc.edu/~ico

P.S. How do you implement reading of a sound faster and slower than it
sounds in such a gradual fashion? Do you adjust the sampling rate of the
DSP and if so does that affect other streams coming from the
libalsaplayer, or is this something that is sound-specific (and if so,
how)?

You can turn on JACK ports for each instrument, then run them
through jack-rack or similar (or into ardour).

Can you be more specific about the problems with increased periods?
I would like to further contribute to hydrogen's realtime safeness
(although precision and accuracy problems you seem to be describing).

Does someone experiment these errors before ?
I'm runing Mandrake 9.1, qjackctl 0.0.9a from thac's rpms works fine.

the license that Mark is referring to is the Sampling License.


thats the point of CC though - it isnt about free / non-free, its about 
choice. some people feel as strongly about public domain as others do 
about free software / free music. CC is just there to facilitate an easy 
selection of licenses which are watertight legally, so that musicians / 
artists / writers / filmmakers can get on with doing what they do best, 
and licensing it according to their views.

personally, i use the Attribution-Share-Alike license, which is pretty 
much a translation of the GPL.

but i will not be forced to judge that as being somehow 'better' than 
Tom Poe's work with the Public Domain - www.studioforrecording.org.

both are about freedom. and unfortunately, if you really want to enable 
freedom, you also have to allow freedom of choice.

the factionism that i see among some free software advocates disappoints 
me greatly as it is totally in contrast to the spirit of freedom itself. 
we cannot force people to be free - but some seem to be rather keen on 
it. i'd hate to see the evolution of Free Software Nazism - but that 
sort of thing dangerously approaches it.

free the freedom?

Recently I have been contemplating the usefulness of making standalone 
guis for a few of the really popular LADSPA plugins. I'm sure people 
would find them useful but is there really much point to spending the 
time on it?

On the other platforms that seems to be the way all the plugins are created.

We now have a complete code base with the jamin (full gui support - not 
so easy to strip down) and jackEQ (not so full support but easier to 
strip down) projects. It wouldn't be hard to change a few simple things 
and recode the guis which is basically what I did for jackEQ.

On one hand I like the idea of having a herd of standalone LADSPA guis 
and on the other hand I don't want to waste time on something that is 
only marginally more useful than jack-rack or ecamegapedal, etc...

The one thing I am missing now is a complete echo solution. I'm torn 
between spending copious amounts of time on ssm trying to understand the 
code to get the echo plugin stable enough for my use(among other bugs in 
ssm) or refactoring it into a LADSPA plugin and giving it it's own gui.

Decisions, decisions...

Hallo,



Well, even the FSF recommends to look at CC for licensing of art. I
only have a problem with the "non-commercial only" part of some
licenses (I think, it's only one of the CC licenses), because this
like "pollutes the environment", that CC also tries to create. CC is
not only about legal issues, it is also about making sharing possible.
So even the "no commercial" license explicitly allows distribution in
non-commercial ways and creates the impression, that it still is a
free licence, when in fact it isn't anymore.

I'm not sure, if I can express my point as clear as I could in my
native language, though.

because he is *so* uncompromising. if he had compromised and watered 
things down from the start, then by the time it filters through the 
layers of apathy in our society we wouldnt have anything left. as it is, 
the watered down forms of freedom are still useful.

turning a blind eye is okay in some respects - in fact you could say i 
as a free software advocate am turning a blind eye to 'open source' with 
my attitude. but actually i'm feeling very strongly that we campaigners 
for freedom are missing a very important element out of our freedom - 
the freedom to choose. and that includes the freedom to choose 
proprietary software, god forbid. we HAVE to have this attitude though, 
otherwise we are total hypocrites by virtue of our own standards. i 
support Creative Commons because it offers everyone the freedom to 
choose - and puts all options before us, from proprietary through to 
Free, open source but non-commercial and finally public domain. and all 
permutations in between. the emphasis though is the same as that of free 
software campaigns - promoting the Community or 'Commons' - giving back 
to the community rather than taking from it. *that* is what Larry Lessig 
is *really* on about.

i have an aversion to religious extremism or fanaticism, having been 
brought up in such an environment. but i also dont throw the baby out 
with the bathwater (and haven't with my faith either, even though i wont 
attend a church). fanaticism implies a lack of freedom, and free 
software campaigners need to be very careful NOT to fall into the trap 
of fanaticism.

argh, its about time i started a Copyleftmedia discussion list instead 
of rabbiting on on l-a-u ;-)

hi.

it really *is* about time i got a Copyleftmedia discussion list going 
(Copyleftmedia is my website devoted to copyleft licensing of the arts - 
and is a supporter and participant in iCommons, the internationalisation 
of Creative Commons).



CC itself doesnt really concern itself with 'free' or 'non-free' - in 
fact i dont think you'll see those terms used at all on the website, 
certainly not in the 'Free software / Software Libre' sense.

CC is concerned with 'the Commons' - the community of artists and the 
community of material created by artists.

this is what it has in common with Free Software - the emphasis on 
community. on creating a Commons of material which we can draw from and 
share.

CC also wants to be inclusive of all sorts of different efforts towards 
making this Commons or community happen. in that sense, while i prefer 
to use the GPL-style 'Attribution - Share-Alike' license for my own 
works, i am pleased to be able to support non-commercial and public 
domain licenses. i know people who feel as strongly about the public 
domain (go visit the DMCA_discuss list to meet them :) as we do about 
Free software. but i also know producers who are too scared to license 
their works as completely Free yet. i feel that any move towards Freedom 
or Commons or whatever we want to call it is a good one - and better 
than the proprietary option. i dont think Open Source is bad, but in my 
own works i choose Free.

the difference with CC is that it doesnt discriminate between any of 
these efforts towards the Commons, but acts as an umbrella to foster all 
of them and bring people together. now THAT is something missing in our 
community - communication. since i began Copyleftmedia i noticed that 
there are dozens of Free / Open Music licenses of various sorts but 
hardly any of them know of each other's existence. putting them all 
together is what i want to do - to build community. i think its damaging 
to start saying 'you're not part of my community because you dont 
entirely share every bit of my philosophy'. why not focus on what we 
have in common - its far more powerful to work together than to split 
into factions - which i think is hypocritical, because its contrary to 
the very spirit of Freedom and Commons.


yeah, i understand. i'd say go ahead and say it in German, but my 
reading thesedays is rather rudimentary and based on understanding Dutch 
which is my second language... i could give it a go, though... but i 
might then struggle just as much to understand... ! :(

greetings

Try running as root and with jackd -R -d alsa -d hw:0 -p 512

also try increasing -n 4 (6,8,10..), it might help for the xruns. But I'd
say that running with realtime (-R) will do the job.


Remember to start ardour as the same user you start jackd.

Hi again

Sorry to be bothering you so much since the information probably lies out 
there somewhere, but when I come to alsa-project.org and simular, I just get 
lost in all the tech-talk. (Quite annoying for someone with a phd to feel 
that lost... )

Anyway': Since the staudio c-port's midi in wont work (unless the patch on 
http://www.linuxhq.com/kernel/file/sound/pci/ice1712.c makes it work, but I 
couldn't find anything there to tell me how to a)check if I allready had tha 
patch, b)what it does, or c) how to apply it - being an old wintel gui slave 
is not satisfacotry...) I decided to activate the soundcard on my Asus P4T-E 
card. the soundcard is found by my mandrake 9.2 installation, but the midi 
port doesn't come up when I type 'aconnet -io'.

Could aome kind soul be so kind as to show me how to find out if the midi in 
works and how to activate it?

Your most humble fan!

The AC'97 controller can be autodetected because it's a PCI device,
but this isn't the case for the MIDI port.

Use the snd-mpu401 driver, and set the port and irq parameters to the
same values you've configured in the BIOS setup, i.e.:

	alias snd-card-0 snd-ice1712
	alias snd-card-1 snd-intel8x0
	alias snd-card-2 snd-mpu401
	options snd-ice1712 index=0

I'm not sure that it does damage the commons. For professional artists 
to contribute to the commons, there has to be a safeguard against 
loss of livelihood.

Bear in mind that reserving the right of commercial exploitation for 
yourself doesn't mean that work can't be commercially distributed - 
it just means a prospective commercial distributor would have to have 
the artists' blessing to do it, and I don't see what's wrong with 
that.

I don't think any musician (professional or otherwise) would put out a 
CD if they knew a commercial rival - who hadn't put a cent into 
artist wages or album production - could duplicate that CD 
legitimately and sell it at a lower price in the same market, perhaps 
with better distribution.

Even independent releases by amateur artists have to be paid for, and 
just imagine how upset you'd be if your CD became popular and some 
label that didn't care about your music made a lot of money on it, 
while you couldn't even afford to record a follow-up.

If musicians had been able to preserve this right for themselves, 
instead of signing it over to labels, then maybe the record industry 
would have been very different. I believe the opera singer Caruso, 
who was one of the very first musicans to record, was able to 
negotiate a deal where he would get a 10% of retail royalty. I've 
heard the standard these days is more like 12% of wholesale before 
deductions - so much for a hundred years of progress!

I have a small project that I'm recording for a friend and this is my
first use of hopefully several projects using ardour as my DAW. 
(BTW, these are not paying gigs, just low-risk projects.)  I'm having
some mixdown problems I need help with.  I haven't been very good
about keeping up with releases.  For this project I'm on 0.9beta3,
but I will upgrade to 0.9beta6 before this weekend for the next
project.

Anyway, I can't figure out how to mixdown tracks with effects.  I'm
using a single-band PEQ and plate reverb in the pre-fader column for
each track and using the outputs of each track as the inputs of the
stereo track that eventually goes to disk, but for some reason the
stereo track is recorded dry.  If I solo it, the mix is dry.  If I
listen only to the mix of the individual tracks, it's wet.  

So here's my questions:
1.  Is it possible (and how) to bounce a wet mix to a stereo track
that will be exported to a .wav file?

2.  Is there currently any way, or are there plans to add support for
exporting an entire mix to disk instead of bouncing to a stereo track
to be exported?  (Of course you can do that now, but it's a dry mix.)
 I guess I'm asking for a non-realtime mixdown feature.

3.  Somewhat related, is it possible to delete or undo automations?

Thanks,
Greg




-->><<--__-->><<--

Answering my original question, I just got the Midiman DMAN PCI 
working with Mandrake 9.1 for both playback and recording. Haven't 
tried the MIDI yet.

These cards are now long discontinued, and are like a forerunner to 
the M Audio Audiophile with their RCA (phono) jacks instead of 1/8" 
sockets. They can only do up to 48KHz sample rate, but they are very 
cheap for a reasonable quality PCI soundcard. Mine only cost me a few 
pounds on eBay.

Cheers

You need to enable "Run plugins while recording" in the Options
Editor/Misc tab.

Yes, there are plans to do a proper non-realtime mixdown, once
JACK supports it (soon).  This will be in before Ardour 1.0.

 > 3.  Somewhat related, is it possible to delete or undo automations?

Do you mean delete automation lines and points?  Yes to both.
To delete the entire automation, click on the "a" button in the
track button bar and select one of the Clear choices.  To remove
a single automation control point, go into "auto" mouse mode,
then Shift-Right click on a point will remove it.

Generally it is in your /etc/modules.conf file

Some distros auutomatically generate this file from other files though. In that case you have to modify the file that it uses to generate the ALSA section within modules.conf

For example in Debian it's something like /etc/modutils/alsa
On my Gentoo box it's found at /etc/modules.d/alsa

Hope that helps.

You might try sending channel and FX outputs to a bus and then using that bus as the input for your stereo track. (Just a shot in the dark)

For the time being, you could either bus everything to one bus and send it 
via JACK to a JACK enabled recorder, or send all individual tracks to a 
JACK enabled recorder. Thats what I do at the moment.

BEAST/BSE version 0.5.5 is available for download at:

  ftp://beast.gtk.org/pub/beast/v0.5
or
  http://beast.gtk.org/beast-ftp/v0.5

BEAST (the Bedevilled Audio SysTem) is a graphical front-end to
BSE (the Bedevilled Sound Engine), a library for music composition,
audio synthesis, MIDI processing and sample manipulation.
The project is hosted at:

  http://beast.gtk.org


This new development series of BEAST comes with a lot of
the internals redone, many new GUI features and a sound
generation back-end separated from all GUI activities.

The most outstanding new features are the demo song, the effect and
instrument management abilities, the track editor which allowes
for easy selection of synthesizers or samples as track sources, loop
support in songs and unlimited Undo/Redo capabilities.

Note, if you encounter problems with .bse files from previous BEAST
versions, this may indicate bugs at the compatibility layer.
A bug report accompanied by the problematic file can be send to the
mailing list and is likely to get you a fixed file in return.

Overview of Changes in BEAST/BSE 0.5.5:

* New (or ported) modules:
  DavCanyonDelay - Canyon Echo by David A. Bartold
  BseMidiInput   - Monophonic MIDI Keyboard input module
  BseBalance     - Stereo panorama position module
  ArtsCompressor - Mono and stereo compressor [Stefan Westerfeld]
* Added utility script to crop and duplicate parts [Stefan Westerfeld]
* Added "Party Monster" demo song [Stefan Westerfeld]
* Implemented ability to use sequencer as modulation source
* Added support for external MIDI events in song tracks
* Added .bse file playback facility to bsesh
* Added support for C++ Plugins
* Now installs bse-plugin-generator for simple creation of C++ Modules
* Added manual pages for installed executables
* Lots of small MIDI handling fixes
* Fixed MP3 loader
* Major GUI improvements
* Registered MIME types for .bse files, provided .desktop file
* Made search paths for various resources user configurable
* Added prototype support to IDL compiler [Stefan Westerfeld]
* Work around PTH poll() bug on NetBSD [Ben Collver, Tim Janik]
* Support NetBSD sound device names [Ben Collver]
* Added i18n infrastrukture for BEAST and BSE [Christian Neumair, Tim Janik]
* Added Azerbaijani translation [Metin Amiroff]
* Added Russian translation [Alexandre Prokoudine]
* Added Serbian translation [Danilo Segan]
* Added Swedish translation [Christian Rose]
* Added German translation [Christian Neumair]
* Added Czech translation [Miloslav Trmac]
* Added Dutch translation [Vincent van Adrighem]
* Lots of bug fixes

I have been doing something similar for quite a while now.  There may
be better ways, but this still works fine.

Create a stereo bus and connect your audio tracks to it.  Use this bus
to apply stereo effects, like freeverb and SC4 (a good stereo
compressor).  Connect the bus outputs to the appropriate playback
channels so you can hear what you're getting.  Then, create two more
audio tracks, Mix_L and Mix_R.  Connect the left and right bus outputs
to them, and use them to record the (wet) mix.  Then, export those two
tracks to a stereo WAV file.

When I first started using this scheme, ardour could not export a
stereo track to a WAV file.  It probably can now, and that would be
more natural than the Mix_L, Mix_R solution described above.  You may
want to experiment a bit.

This may sound complicated, but it's actually pretty easy.

Hi,


This is probably just an elaboration on what Luke and
others have already stated. You could setup pre or
post sends in the instrument mixerstrip. Then use the
sends as sources for effects buses. Afterwards add new
tracks with the effect buss as sources and record the
effect to the track.

Example usage; backing vocals may require level X of
reverb except at the end of a chorus going into a
bridge where +10db of reverb would cause an
interesting mix affect.

With post fader sends the amount of signal to the bus
can inherit levels from source track automation.

Now you've got the original track and the output of a
reverb or whatever. This isn't always the fastest
solution but it does allow you to turn off effects,
and provides good mix time control.

Mix to Stereo
Create Mixer template with instrument tracks and
master stereo bus. Add stereo track with master bus as
source. Configure stereo bus as the source for stereo
trakc and record. Or do as Luke suggested with another
jack client. For example; jack graph with ardour,
rezound and jamin. Ardour stereo bus to Rezound
(destructive editing) and then Rezound to JAMin. Or
Ardour stereo bus to JAMin (master with multitrack
source) and then JAMin output to Rezound or back into
Ardour.

There's many routing possibilities. Jackd rules!

Such a plugin would be good to use with terminatorX - being able to
'scratch' mp3 files in conjunction with a 'vinyl sound' LADSPA plugin
would be pretty cool :-) Has anyone put their hand up to create such a
LADSPA pugin, and if so can it be created as a mono plugin so it can
work with tX?

This is a followup to a message I wrote nearly a year ago, but the
problem has finally only been resolved today (at least that which could
be resolved).  I felt a followup might be useful to others who may
encounter the same problems or come up with the same questions ...



All still true ...


After having spent the last six months or so with the system in a
basically unusable state (for an unrelated reason), I have finally
upgraded to Slackware-9.1 (Linux-2.4.22), and installed alsa-driver-0.9.8,
alsa-lib-0.9.8 and alsa-utils-0.9.8.


still true ...


I have finally resolved this issue, thanks to a note I found at the
"ALSA HOWTO WIKI" (http://alsa.opensrc.org/)  On the page which
discusses the cs46xx driver
(http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=cs46xx), I noticed this
paragraph referring to the Midiman DMAN card:

   If you find you can't record with this card, open up the alsamixer and
   set the following 3 channels to "capture": LINE, CAPTURE, and ADC. You
   of course have to unmute and set levels, but it takes all 3 of these
   channels set to capture mode in order to record on the Midiman DMAN.
       
I tried this on my own card, found that it works (finally, I can record
using this soundcard!), and added a note that this also applies to
the Hercules Gamesurround Fortissimo II soundcard.  Thanks to who-ever
took the time to post that information about the DMAN card!


still true.  I'm still assuming this is a limitation in the hardware.


Resolved!  :-)  (at least for a single source;  I'm using a hardware
mixer anyway, so it isn't critical that I'm unable to record-enable
multiple sources)

[ starting jackd at boot-time ]

Still unresolved.  I'm no longer certain that I'll want to run Jack at
boot-time, as it seems I may want to not use it with some applications
(someone please correct me if I'm wrong about that...)


I'd still like to do this, but it isn't critical.


It has become clear to me that the cs46xx ALSA driver does not contain
support for the built-in synth on these cards.  Is this due to lack of
documentation?  lack of interest?  other?

It has taken a lot of patience, and much more work than I expected,
but I finally have a computer which I may be able to once again use for
recording and sequencing (Audacity works and Rosegarden-4 is looking very
nice... Ardour is most definitely going to be looked at!)  Much thanks is
owed to all those who have contributed to the software and documentation
which has made this possible.  Perhaps I can repay the favour someday ...

As you trimmed the output we dont know what other hardware could be causing
problems, but still, it looks ok. 

so which card are you trying to use? the ensoniq i guess.



looks ok.
to use jack you only need "snd", "snd-pcm" and "snd-ens1370"



ok, no problem. Module info is more useful anyway.



looks probably ok.
probably you havnt saved your mixer settings?
they live in /etc/asound.state (or your home dir)
you might want to create one using the alsactl program as root.
(i dont know why disributions dont do this as part of the alsa installation)



er, isnt this from last week? :-)



ok.

all looks ok.

one further check: look in /proc/asound/cards
there should be just one card "card0"


i originally thought this was an error but i guess it is just
you hitting Ctl-C.

it looks like alsa is not the problem, but before moving onto jack
maybe it would be wise to check recording from the soundcard input
rather than stdin.

jack:

how often are the xruns? or are they too fast to count?

pls post the first few lines of jack output.

you are running everything as root arnt you?
is the kernel compiled with low-latency and preemtible options?

maybe dont start with ardour as its undergoing rapid development
atm. Better to imo use eg 'alsaplayer -o jack'. Also use one of
the jack control guis such as qjackconnect or qjackctl to check
jackd has 2 input ports and 2 output ports.


cheers!

Cheesetracker is a portable Impulse Tracker clone. It supports all the main 
Impulse Tracker and FastTracker/SoundTracker features, plus many more.
It is licensed under the GNU Public License. It runs under
Linux/BSDs, MacOSX(QT/Mac or Qt/X11), or Win32(Cygwin).

It can be obtained at http://cheesetronic.sf.net

For those unfamiliar with trackers, this is basically an
all-in-one sequencer/sampler/sample editor/mixer/fx processor bundle,
wich provides fast and flexible means for professional grade
music composing. 

Including in the release are tutorials and documentation.
Volunteers to help to better documment it would
be highly appreciated.

The ChangeLog for this release follows:

v0.9.0
------

-Removed sample mode (Scream Tracker 3 mode) as It's obsolete and not needed 
for backwards compatibility.
-Instruments are now layered and can perform up to 4 simultaneous voices with 
individual parameters each.
-Added an effect buffers system. Instruments are now routed to custom buffers 
(each with individual effect chains), which can also re-route to other 
buffers. This allows to create very complex effect routes for realtime 
processing.
-Effect buffers are "process on demand", which means they are smart enough to 
notice when they are doing nothing, thus disabling themselves.
-Added a few internal effects: Amplifier, Clipping/Distortion, Recursive Delay 
Line, Stereo Enhancer, Chorus and Reverb.
-Added a LADSPA effect source plugin. LADSPA plugins can be added to the 
chains.
-Created new file formats that save all the new features: .CT (CheeseTracker 
Module) .CI (Cheesetracker Instrument) and .CS (CheeseTracker Sample)
-Added preview to the sample file selection box, just hilite a file and use 
your keyboard to play notes (/ and * work in there too).
-Readded JACK Driver (Kasper Souren)
-Added RTAUDIO driver, allows for porting to Win32/ASIO and OSX/CoreAudio
-Fixed some big endian compatibility issues. CheeseTracker should work fine 
again on big endian machines.
-MacOSX port and build system/build fixes courtesy of Benjamin Reed
-Fixed tons and tons of bugs.

AND NOW PLEASE READ: How fast CheeseTracker reaches version 1.0 depends on 
YOU. The focus of this version is STABILITY. Because of this, I need to 
receive as many bug reports as I can, both program and build system. If you 
find a bug, I'd be enormously grateful if you submit it. Even if it is an 
obvious bug to you, chances that other people will find and report the same 
bug are much smaller than what you may think. If you dont report a bug that 
annoys you, the chances of it reappearing in the next version will allways be 
higher.

Planned for 1.0.0:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

-Rock Solid stability
-WAV exporting
-A hopefully working Windows port. This depends mainly on the Qt-Win32 
project. If you are a good Windows programmer and would like to see 
CheeseTracker working in there sooner, please give those guys a hand!

Enjoy!!

Hallo,


But then it cannot be distributed commercially freely by anyone. It
cannot be sold if you don't get a special permission to do so. So
actually the license doesn't give the user the full rights. 

I don't quite see, why the right to use something commercially must be
considered something else than the right to run a program, listen to a
CD or give away a book.

I understand that musicians want to get paid for their music. I have
several friends who must live from their music's income. But rejecting
a licensee the right to commercial use simply is another kind of
license than what a free license should allow. 

I mean, programmers like Paul Davis put months and years of work into
free software, too, without holding back the right to commercial use.
Commercial use only has to follow "the rules" like: no
copy-protection, no rights' stealing, etc. And Paul surely wants to
eat, too. Why should artists get to keep more rights for themselves
than the programmers?

What you seem to be saying is that user freedom is more important than 
artist freedom. Why should an artist be compelled to to grant rights 
to users? Free software, or culture, is a gift - it's not something 
that users can demand.


Because we live in a capitalist economy where artists still have to 
buy food even if they give their work away for free. I can really 
understand why an artist would not want some parasite making a good 
living from their work while the creator of that work starved. It's 
not like that's a new situation - ask a van Gogh dealer how much they 
make.


That's a matter of opinion. The original Ghostscript licence is just 
one example of a licence that prevents third-party commercialisation. 
I think it's worth pointing out that when Richard Stallman wrote the 
GPL, he was working in an academic environment and he didn't have a 
family to support.


Sure, and that's Paul's right to do so because he wrote the code - but 
Paul is also asking for financial support for Ardour from users and 
has proposed an added-value distribution which will be sold. It's up 
to Paul to work out a business model that suits him, but I doubt he 
would be happy if other people were selling an added value version 
and not putting at least some of the money back into development. 


In theory they should not, but in practice the treatment of artists 
has been much worse than that of programmers. A merely average 
programmer has been able to make a good living over the past 20 or so 
years, but that isn't true of artists.

Besides, if you really believe in artist freedom, then the artist 
should have the freedom not to grant any rights to users over their 
work. Of course, it would also be the case that the users should have 
the freedom to ignore the work of those artists.

With the advent of DRM, I'm having no difficulty ignoring music that I 
didn't want to listen to anyway. The day my radio can silence Madonna 
because I haven't paid her, I'll be a happy man...

Hallo,


I am not. You seem to misunderstand me.


Yes, free software and free music is a gift. The non-commercial CC
license makes it a gift with a catch, or actually it makes it not a
gift at all in some sense. (One could argue, that GPL-free also has a
catch, by disallowing to take the gift away)
That's all what I'm saying. I'm not demanding musicians or software
authors to do anything or give me anything. I also don't (want to)
agitate against non-commercial licenses. But "non-commercial use or
distribution only" means non-free, that's all that I'm saying.

And personally I don't like the close neighbourhood of a non-free
license to the free licenses within the CC license bunch, because it
gives the impression, that "non-commercial use/dist. only" still means
free, when in fact it doesn't, it just means "sometimes yes, sometimes
not".

-->><<--__-->><<--

I disagree. We don't usually offer a gift to someone and expect the 
recipient to sell it. That's not a catch, that's just an expectation 
of civilised behaviour.


I'm not sure the 'freedom' to make a living from someone else's work 
without contributing back is something that licences should 
encourage. I'm not talking about remixers or samplers here - people 
who take the work and add something to it. I'm talking about the 
people who would sell the work as it is without adding any value, and 
keep the money for themselves.

The major commercial Linux distributions don't allow this sort of 
behaviour any more. They use things like trademark law, or dual 
licences, to prevent it.

In the case of music, if someone wanted to distribute a CC'd licenced 
piece commercially, paying the artist a fair cut, then all they'd 
have to do is contact the artist in the usual way and work out a 
deal. What's wrong with that?

Cheers

Daniel



-->><<--__-->><<--

It's not so much "more rights" as "different rights".  In the 
software arena you have source code you can hold back or give 
out, and the GPL requires that you give it out.  This is because 
there are two ways to "use" software.... you can run it (the 
typical definition of "use") or you can incorporate some of its 
code into your own program.  

While this certainly happens in music, whether by sampling in the 
case of electronic forms or by quoting melodies and chord 
progressions in more traditional forms, there's not quite the 
same synergy to this kind of "source code sharing" as there is 
in programming.  I haven't seen a free music license yet that 
requires you to make your original unprocessed multitrack 
recordings and/or sheet music available if you use music under 
the license in your own project, for example.

So we look at the effects of the GPL and try to come up with 
something analogous for music.  The GPL is basically written so 
that the code can spread far and wide without being co-opted and 
ultimately controlled by some big corporation with an agenda.  
In the music biz, that big corporation is analagous to the 
RIAA-associated record companies, or perhaps the people that use 
music in commercials, movie soundtracks, etc.  I think the 
definition varies for each artist.

The best I've been able to come up with for my own experiments so 
far is "verbatim electronic distribution via the internet 
permitted, all other rights reserved, contact me if you're 
interested".  Maybe there's some existing free music license 
that's this way (kind of like the dual GPL/commercial license 
used by Qt and some other projects.)  But even more than 
programmers, musicians have different goals with their music.  I 
don't think you'll ever see one particular free music license 
become ascendant for that reason, and I don't know what a good 
catch-all license would entail.  But I understand the intent of 
the "no commercial use" licenses.  They wouldn't qualify as 
FSF-approved free software licenses, but then, they're not 
covering software.

The licence I use is quite similar:

http://mondodesigno.com/music/pml.html

except that I don't specify internet distribution as the only 
acceptable medium.

Personally, I find the Creative Commons licences far too legalistic 
and contractual. I like the way you've reduced your licence to a 
single sentence that could be easily understood and translated.

I always think it's funny when people say things like 'The Chinese 
don't respect software licences', because if a EULA was written in 
Chinese I know I wouldn't even be able to read it, let alone 
understand it. Though they are written in lawyer's English, even 
native English speakers can't be bothered to read them.

Neglecting the need for musicians to eat, the actual production of 
music costs money. It may be studio time or the cost of buying your 
own equipment, but it isn't gratuit, free as in beer, or 'gratis' as 
we say in England.

On the other hand, if I sell you a CD of music that you can 
redistribute, sample or remix, then it's probably more 'libre' than a 
CD which is gratis, but has DRM on it.

Hallo,


Maybe, but we also wouldn't disallow anyone to sell a gift. There are
many reasons why someone would sell a gift, for example because some
money is needed and everything else's already sold.


True, and this is the catch of the "share alike" in creative commons
or open sourc/free software licenses: You can sell, but you must not
take away rights when selling.


Just some more food for thought:

CC is discussing a sampling license currently, see
http://creativecommons.org/projects/cc-sampling. This is of course an
interesting concept, but I keep asking myself, what other licenses the
lawyers will come up with, when future, yet unknown "common" uses will
pop up. Today it's sampling, that gets a special treatment, yesterday
it was filesharing, tomorrow it might be "public place sound
designing" or whatever. All these use cases might require special
exceptions to allow them without charge for some people. Compare that
to the simplicity of a real free license. You wouldn't need a
"sampling license" if you would be allowed to "sample" the whole tune
for whatever purpose in the first place.

But I'm getting utopian now, I know. It's an old grassroot anarchist
heritage coming up again...

remind me and keep kicking me until i link to this on Copyleftmedia.

the point of Copyleftmedia is to unite people who are using all types of 
free / open / Creative Commons licenses.

i dont believe in discrimination between them, i believe in discussion 
of why one person may choose one, and one person chooses another. that 
takes us a hell of a lot further towards change in the way we approach 
copyright than fighting each other.

Hi,
   I've got two Linux boxes, one Gentoo and the other PlanetCCRMA. I
need to move about 10GB of data from one to the other. How can I do
this? I guess that over Ethernet maybe Samba or NFS might work? I don't
know anything about making either of these technologies work, and
obviously I don't want to start building kernels or anything like that
to get there. 

   Has anyone got a tutorial on how to do this easily. I really don't
want to become an IT guy to make this work.

   If it's too difficult, then I could dig up and add a 1394 adapter to
one box and dump it to the other that way. The second machine has 1394
already. I just didn't want to open the box up and mess with cards.

Thanks very super much in advance,
Mark

If it's a one time kind of job, from the machine with
the data  on it 'scp foo
username@machinename:/home/username/destination/' or
from remote 'scp
username@machinename:/home/username/filename .' will
copy to the directory from which you execute the
command.

If you need to mirror then a .bashrc function in
conjunction with a script can help:
mirror ()
{
~/bin/rsync-clients
}

#!/bin/bash
#rsync mirror of daddy:/raid0/studio/clients, do not
delete local files which don't exist at the

directory, cp links to local destination directory--do
not create link structure or copy to that destination

if you don't have NFS support in your kernels and don't want to bother,
rsync is easy to install and use. Locally, it might transfer a 
bit faster if you use it with rsh instead of ssh  (you set this with 
the RSYNC_RSH environment variable as per the rsync manpage).

NFS isn't too hard, though. google will find you some tutorials.

Anyway I have no doubt that we agree on the GNU principles in this forum.=
 I was following the very interesting discussion about how to transpose i=

(please everyone excuse my poor english. I hope I will be able to express=
 my ideas in a clear way)

I believe GNU can  be translated near without any modifications into musi=
c. The key point is understanding what is the "source", talking about mus=
ic.
The idea of making availabe the separated audio tracks seems actually har=
d to make (lots of space and cpu time needed).
But historically, the on-paper printed score is the musical "source" that=
 was shared/sold. Now it can be a midifile or better an abc file.

The abc (or midi file) file is human readable (the midifile is not direct=
ly human readable, although it's an very well established standard).
The abc file contains all the information needed to reproduce the music, =
and the resulting music will depend on the hardware (soundcard) as much a=
s a program that runs faster on a faster cpu or with a better compiler. S=
ome could even say that the compiler is the musician who will play the re=
sulting score. Yes that's my final goal. But some would just like to hear=
 the song.

More, the abc file is very small, has the place to contain the authors an=
d the license.

We can want to hear the singer audio tracks, but that is the case where w=
e got to pay the musician for (as well as paying redhat premium services)=
. So there is way to make money (playing live music, that can work , beli=
eve me) but not upon the source/score.=20

Jazz actually exists because musicians can share tons of standards. And o=
f course this is a problem because lots of songs are copyrighted. Technic=
ally lots of people are guilty giving music pleasure to people.

Today I'd like to have music available for free when I play music. I want=
 to tell the listeners that I'm playing a song of XXX, with modifications=
 by YYYY and interpretaion by me. I  want to modify a song I love. I want=
 to re-use some groovy drums, some clever bass, some smart lyrics. Today =
it's not possible. We are at best in the situation of ten years before on=
 windows with all the shareware available for free (tons of midifile on t=
he web) but no license permetting the use.

I for one would like to put my poor own songs available under a GNU-Music=
 license, i.e. redistribution is allowed as soon as it allows other (me i=
ncluded) to profit back from the resulting work.


I think that these ideas exist before this post and I hope that I didn't =
express them in a dumb way.. I'd like to discuss about it, but please, no=
t about money. It's a dead horse, beaten everyday when someone talks abou=
t GNU.=20

Once again, the point is given choice to people and to artists.

This is a very deep subject.  There are some reasonably accessible

I have no personal experience with Samba, but I hear it is difficult

FTP should be easy to get working.  It is quite adequate for moving
the amounts of data you mention, in fact it's probably the most
efficient method for moving large data files over an Ethernet.

Depending on your security needs the Berkeley "r-commands" (rsh, rcp,
rlogin, etc.) are quite convenient.  You can do things like...

  $ tar cf - * | rsh otherhost tar xf -

But, if your machines are accessible from the Internet, don't do this,
it is insecure.  Use the secure `ssh' instead.  Ssh is more difficult
to configure, but sends no unencrypted passwords across the network.

Hi,

If this is a one-time move, which I suspect it is. Then ftp is by far the 
easiest way.

If there are no ftp-servers running on your machines(this will be self evident 
when you try to connect from the other machine), they are probably 
preinstalled, start it via the appropriate /etc/init.d/<script> and then run 
an ftp client from the other machine. gftp seems to come with many new 
distributions, plain ftp in a console works also (should always be 
installed).

Hi Mark -

If you do go ftp, there is also the Redhat "mouse-click-only" method
(this is on the server end):

- Grab a pure-ftpd rpm and install it.
- Go to "System Settings->Server Settings->Services", and...
- Start pure-ftpd by selecting it and clicking, you guessed it,
"Start".

You are now serving ftp from your planet box (planetoid) on port 21. 
Just open the firewall to FTP in "System Settings->Security Level". 
Dump away with gFTP or another.  Note: You may need to turn off
"Passive file transfer" in the gFTP "FTP->Options" in order to connect
correctly.

On the other hand, SSH is likely already running and open (and
secure!), though the copy will be slower.  gFTP will do ssh too, as
well:

scp [-r] MY_10GB_OF_STUFF user-bBLpc489ys/W3/XBoqnc3Q@public.gmane.org:/remote/dir

The -r is for recursive copying.

I'd recoomend scp -r too, its just easier.

if you add -c blowfish it will go quicker, as the alogirthm is cheaper

Mark,

	On the machine that you want to be the source (as root):

edit /etc/exports and add the line:

/source_partition destination_system(rw)

where source_partition is the file system that you wish to share and
destination system is the name of the destination system (as shown in
/etc/hosts) or its IP address (192.168.0.whatever).  (rw) gives read and
write access to the destination system.  Then enter the following:

chkconfig portmap on
chkconfig nfs on
/etc/rc.d/init.d/portmap start
/etc/rc.d/init.d/nfs start


	On the destination system (as root):


chkconfig portmap on
chkconfig nfs on
chkconfig amd on
/etc/rc.d/init.d/portmap start
/etc/rc.d/init.d/nfs start
/etc/rc.d/init.d/amd start


At this point, if you do:

cd /net/source_system
ls

you should see the source_partition.  I'm not sure if chkconfig is
available on all systems.  It is on RH.  On a RH system you can also use
"sevice nfs start" instead of "/etc/rc.d/init.d/nfs start".  The
chkconfig lines make these services start on boot so if you only want to
do it once don't do that on either system.  amd is the automounter
daemon.  All of this assumes that you have your network cards configured
so that each machine can see the other.  It's also handy to have the
name and IP address of each machine in the /etc/hosts file.

Actually, if you look at: 

http://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.html

you'll see that originally, there was no distinction made between the 
two English meanings of 'free'. That came later.

I think it's unrealistic to expect that if you want to distribute 
something commercially, then you should have a right not to pay for 
it. It breaks the virtuous circle that makes free software great.

I think an important distinction between music and software is that 
software requires active developer input to retain its commercial 
value, and the equivalent isn't true of music. For example, plenty of 
1950's music still has commercial value, but most 1950's software 
does not. 

Given the often short careers of musicians, there must be plenty of 
people who are still getting an income from those old hits. (Probably 
not the musicians who made them, but that's another story - just ask 
the Rolling Stones). Without a 'pension' in the form of retained 
commercial rights, what would those people do? Be forced to keep 
playing live until they look like a bunch of ridiculous old men 
prancing around on stage? You've got to feel sorry for them - I'm 
sure they'd rather be playing golf or something.

i think you can specify a filename with arecord...

maybe ecasound, rezound, sweep, or audacity might help also.

but i do think its important to check that both soundcard "in"

the only time i have seen this is when there was a problem
with alsa, but who knows? But it does seem to indicate that
jack is not at all happy with alsa for some reason.


you could maybe try jack with "--playback" option....



unfortunately, head is not showing some output from jack.

you are missing this line:
creating alsa driver ... hw:0|hw:0|4096|2|48000|nomon|swmeter|rt

this is useful cos it shows how jack is actually running.



maybe its standard?
does your kernel compile ".config" file have "CONFIG_PREEMPT=3Dy"?

Right. I am *sort of* familiar with rsync. I think it's part of the
technology that is behind Gentoo's emerge, isn't it?

Anyway, my needs right now are more tactical. I don't (yet) see a long term
need for doing rsync, but it could happen. The data I'm copying is currently
a very large library I've built through purchases and downloads which I use
in Windows and is becoming useful under Linux. The Windows box happens to be
dual boot, so it was easier for me to use scp, with help from the group
here, than deal with Samba between Win ME and Linux.

Thanks again for your help, and the help of everyone here.

but i am quite sure it was the basic stuff as explained in the help.

how are you mounting the samba share on the linux side? my guess is that
you don't specify the user id that the mounted share should have on the
linux side.

if my linux users' uid is 1021, and i want to mount the homedir of user
mdeboer on the mac, with hostname the_mac:

mount -t smbfs -o username=mdeboer,uid=1021 //the_mac/mdeboer /mnt/mac

I believe that portage/emerge uses it, yes.
I find rsync nicer for most of my needs than FTP or scp.

typically what I do is this, to push:

rsync -auv file1 file2 ... user@hostname:/path/to/where/i/want/it

or to pull:

rsync -auv user@hostname:/path/to/something .

It Just Works (tm).
The only subtle gotcha I've found is that 
"rsync foo_directory ." does not mean the same thing as 
"rsync foo_directory/ ."
... this is explained clearly in the EXAMPLES section of the man page.

Also I generally put this in my /etc/profile:
export RSYNC_RSH=/usr/bin/ssh

This particular line is sent to stderr, instead of stdout (which is what head would be reading from).  I'd suggest the following:

jackd -v -d alsa -d hw:0 -p 512 1> jackstdout 2> jackerrout

Let it run for half a second, and then kill it with Ctrl-c.  Both files (jackstdout and jackerrout) should contain more detailed information about what's going on.

Hi,



Does samba create shares that Mac9 can mount?

I haven't looked at Samba during the last four years.
I think it was windows shares only back then. I've
always used atalk and netatalk which has a long
standing bug that causes Mac to not see available
space above 1.2Gb, or something close to that. As you
can imagine that's a real PITA.

No (at least, I don't think so), but I thought you wanted to mount a
share exported by MacOSX with Linux.

Hallo,



I think, I still didn't make it clear what I mean, so I'll try again: 

1) If *the right to distribute* (copies of) a program/music
piece/whatever is bound to paying money to the original author, this
piece of music/software/... is not free in the free speech sense.

2) If the software/track/whatever is only available for money from the
original author, it still can be free in the free speech sense
depending on the license.

I hope you see the distinction I made between the "right to distribute
something" (the license) and the "something". If the right is bound to
giving money to the creator it is not a free good, with free as in
speech, because it would violate the "free distribution of copies"
clause. This does not mean, and I never intended to say this, that you
cannot take money for your work. 

To also quote the FSF (http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html):

"``Free software'' does not mean ``non-commercial''. A free program
must be available for commercial use, commercial development, and
commercial distribution. Commercial development of free software is no
longer unusual; such free commercial software is very important."

I don't think that's true. You could make a political but highly 
commercial record that was subject to censorship in certain 
countries.

But I was talking specifically about commercial distribution. I 
envisage a scenario where non-tangible digital culture can be freely 
redistributed by end users - call it free speech or viral marketing - 
but that culture in a physical format, such as CD or DVD, is sold 
commercially to pay for the costs of production and artist income.

That's what's happening anyway - it's just that the media giants have 
to get real about building a business model out of selling binary 
numbers. iTunes might work for Apple, but I can't see many artists 
making a living out of that kind of commercial distribution. (Apple 
users are well known for being mugs that will buy anything that Apple 
offers, anyway. I've listened to music on an iPod, and I thought it 
sounded crap.)

I blame it on the dot-com boom. The major labels were sold on the idea 
that 'digital goods' would provide massive profit ratios, due to the 
near-zero cost of duplication and distribution. But what they hadn't 
considered is that while this is true for labels, it is also true for 
end users. 


Ah - but you're using the 'free beer' sense in 'free distribution'. 


Practically, you can't charge money for your work if it is able to be 
commercially distributed by a third party without paying you 
anything. That third party can always undercut you on retail price, 
because they aren't putting any money into development.

Cheers

Ah. Thanks for that tip. Will put it on my TODO when it comes time to do 
more updates. Is there a newer version than 0.2.1 BTW?


Good to hear that my work is not in vain.

The cvs one is almost releasable (in fact it's probably more stable than 0.2.1)
It's got alsa midi, jack support that actually works and it's a lot better

Hallo,


What makes you think that? "Free as in speech" distribution can be for
money, too, of course. Unless that's prohibited by the original
license, in which case it's is not a free license.

Each and every single "free" I used in this and all my previous mails
should be read as in free speech, and not a single "free" is meant to
mean "costs nothing" (except where stated as such which, if I remember
it correctly, is nowhere, because I normally use other words for this.)

Well ... still don't work for me.
I still have to edit the source to make it compile :
In SpiralSound/Plugins/JackPlugin/JackPlugin.C line 172 :
change : int JackClient::OnSRateChange(long unsigned int n, void *o)
to : int JackClient::OnSRateChange(jack_nframes_t n, void *o)
Then it compile, but never start .... no errors, nothing, just slow down 
my machine.

My system, Mandrake 9.1, Jack 0.83.5

Because you said  "If the right is bound to giving money to the 
creator it is not a free good". 

I think there's a good reason for having the two meanings of 'free' in 
English - it's because if you don't have any money, you can't afford 
liberty. I would call this a lack of access, or accessibility.

But in the context of online music vs. CDs, the issue isn't that 
peer-to-peer users can't afford CDs - as Eminem pointed out, if you 
can afford a PC and internet connectivity then you can afford to buy 
legitimate, tangible music media.

Rather, it's that existing models of distribution have been 
leapfrogged by the internet, and in the rush to catch up the would-be 
owners of our culture are attempting to dictate how computers should 
be used. As I see it, software like Gnomoradio is part of the 
counter-argument.

... in response to Frank B.



Here's a little scenario, mostly just for me to make sure I understand
these concepts.  I've been glancing at various free licenses lately and
this discussion comes at a right time.

Here it goes:

I set up a website with some music on it in .mp3 and/or .ogg format.  I
can even throw in a .pdf file with the CD cover/label for any DIY kind
of folks.  The music and artwork is available under a free license such
as Frank is suggesting, basically derived from or based on GPL.

In that sense, anyone can download the music and do with it whatever
they pleases them.  I could, optionally, set up a paypal link and ask
for donations.  At the same time, I could offer physical CDs for a small
fee (production and shipping) which could be somewhere around 5$.

Now, some music giant, say Sony Music digs my work (yeah, right...) and
they go 'Oh, we can distribute this guy's work and make millions off him
without paying him a cent!'  But they have to include my license
agreement with their product, my artwork (on which I have my contact
info) etc.  They ship all that to stores and, suppose they're feeling
really generous and they sell it for 15$.  And they make a massive
advertising campaign (they have to if they want to do millions,
right?).  How many people will actually buy it if they see that they can
download it for free (and perhaps leave 1$ on my paypal account) or
order a CD for 5$?

Suppose there is someone who went to the store and bought the thing but
later s/he realized that ripping the CD and sharing it is within his/her
rights.

I don't see how anyone could make money on this...  Even if you
substitute the giant with some small label.

And why would I be unable to charge money for _my_ work, even if it was
distributed by a 3rd party is beyond me.  If they distribute it, they
have to do it on the terms of my license so they cannot claim exclusive
distribution rights.

If, on the other hand, Sony Music hands my CD to some hot shot producer
and they use it, sample it, modify it and sell a billion, they still
have to credit me and make all derivatives under the same license.  I
can't see them stepping into that.  And if they do, my name will be all
over it anyways, so I get free publicity.

In either case I'm a winner.

If none of the above happens, I'm still distributing to a handful of
souls who actually connect with what I do, and I'm still happy.  From
time to time I'll do a show.  Even if I get old I'll be able to do shows
because prancing on stage is not my thing anyways :)

... or did I get it all wrong...?

now THAT is cool.
do you mind if i borrow this... i'm writing some stuff in my book about 
why the GPL actually makes you better off than proprietary.

the other thing is you never get tied into exclusive licenses. if a 
publisher prints my book, i still have the right to go away and get 
someone else to print it, or print it myself. i retain my rights by 
using a Free license. nice fringe benefit when some authors have had 
their books printed, not marketed properly and when they've wanted to 
get the rights back to sell it to another publisher they've found theyre 
in a 2 year or more contract.

i believe the fundamental reason why the FSF has been so successful, 
where other Free Software ventures failed, is that RMS is very shrewd 
with money, and shrewd in setting up infrastructures. he's always got a 
clever idea for how you could build a system like this that actually 
contributes back to the Free Software community. he told me he hates the 
idea of 'business models' - but to compete in that sort of a world, he's 
been very clever with investment, charging for software where necessary, 
and obtaining grants and awards for his work. we could learn a lot from him.

Just imagine that this record company doesn't understand or care about 
your licence, and neglects to include this information. Your only 
recourse would be to sue, and that might not be practical or 
affordable.

Or worse, they do understand your licence, but it gives them the right 
to redistribute your music commercially without paying you. They 
would then have the upper hand in any negotiation, since they aren't 
going to invest in promoting your music without first having got you 
to sign something.


That's exactly the position that labels are in now with conventional 
CDs, and they are still selling.


You're probably right - I think most labels would be very reluctant to 
sign any 'open licenced' artist at the moment.


They don't need exclusive distribution, they just have to be able to 
do it better and cheaper than you!


Again, I think it would be more likely that they would negotiate a 
royalty, just as they do for conventional samples. But if you've 
already declared that your work can be sampled gratuit, then you're 
not likely to get a cut. 
 
Cheers

Daniel



-->><<--__-->><<--


This is impossible.  They all have very competent legal advisers and
can't afford not understanding or not caring.  It would cost them too
much (not to mention reputation).


They would not have an upper hand in negotiations.  I can simply say:
'I'm not signing anything.'  at any time.


Of course they are selling.  People like to have tangible goods. 
However, if you buy a CD in a store (and pay for it >=20$) and read a
legal notice that says that the product is free and you can redistribute
it anyway you like, how will you feel?  And on top of that you go to the
artist's website and you get the whole kit as a free download...


What's better and cheaper than DIY solution?  Here, I even have upper
hand, because I can state on my website that the physical CDs I ship
have a hand-made case and add some other hand -made features.  I will
make them $10 then, or even $20 and collectors and real audiophiles will
buy them from me anyways...  No large publishing company will fool
around with unique copies and such.  Trust me.


But I get exposure.  Gratuit.  If I got a cut it might not be enough to
pay for enough publicity for such exposure and the contract may include
clauses where they don't need to provide the source of their samples and
that I may not be able to use this in my own publicity (this is true, I
know of a musician who played for a house-worming party of one of the
richest people in North America and his contract forbids him to use that
gig in any ad, publication.  He didn't know who he was playing for until
he got there.  Needles to say, he wasn't offered a better fee, either).

I'd be more concerned with a situation like "some political 
organization I have a big problem with decides to use my music 
in their commercial, duly crediting me as per the license so 
that my name is then associated with their organization".

I've recently heard from a number of indie labels, and what I'm 
getting is "we don't care as much about piracy as we do about 
getting our artists heard."  I think you could apply that to 
free music, and I think it could even be successful, but on the 
other hand.... personally I don't want to turn on the radio 
someday and hear "So join the orphaned puppy killers of america.  
Once you kill an orphaned puppy you'll understand. Music 
provided by Rob Kudla."

Hallo,


Yes, but I did talk about the "right", the right to speak freely, so
to say. A good is not a free (as in "libre", liberated, GNUish) good,
if distribution is only allowed when paying somebody. 

If one would only be allowed to distribute Linux, if one did pay Linus
Thorwalds for every copy, then Linux would not only fail to be "free"
as in beer, it also would not be free as in "libre". The distribution
must be allowed without any charges, as soon as I have the good.
That's a central point in all libre software.

Hallo,


You wrote up a good and actually an IMO realistic scenario, at least
for "independent" artists. 

Steve Albini some years ago wrote up, how it currently works in the
music industry, where artists are forced voluntarily to play by
"their" rules: http://www.negativland.com/albini.html
A must-read.

Frank,
   I've read this before. It's a very good read. I agree.

   However, I have no patience or sorrow for people who:

1) Don't read their contracts before they sign.
2) Don't pay a lawyer to translate it to English they understand before they
sign.
3) Hope against all the odds that what they are hearing from the Industry
Lacky vs. what is written and legally agreed to in the contract, will be
done.
4) And then in the face of all of this they go ahead and sign, only later to
complain that they don't like the terms they agreed to.

(Please don't raise the fraud issue here with uneducated people signing
contracts in the music industry. I agree about all the old black blues
musicians in the U.S. - that stinks and I'd like to see that made right. But
that's not what Mr. Albini is talking about, and I refuse to see Sheryl Crow
or Don Hendly as 'uneducated' no matter how much they complain about their
contracts today.)

   I work on contracts all the time. It's part of my job. There are a lot of
times where two sides do not come to agreement, the contract doesn't get
signed, and business doesn't get done. Mr. Albini's story about the trench
filled with stinky stuff makes a great picture. However, I fear that the
truth is most artists are more interested in fame than protecting their
rights. If they wanted to protect their rights, they would either negotiate
better deals, or walk away and find a different way to do it.

   If you sign, and it doesn't work out, no fair complaining about the
terms. You signed it, and you weren't under duress. (That would be illegal.)

   If you walk away, no fair complaining if it doesn't work out. That was
the price of freedom, and the value of freedom.

   I don't know where the GNU-ish version of freedom really fits into this
discussion, but please remember, if NO musician's signed contracts with the
labels, they'd be out of business. The problem is there are too many greedy
people to even have this be the case... ;-)

Cheers,
Mark

actually i've had editors *ahem* actually a certain magazine we both 
know forget to print my license details at the bottom of my articles. i 
license all my articles Free or Creative Commons 'Attribution -

its a typo. the form in which i submit the article is the form in which 
they accepted it, and that would be upheld in a court of law. it would 
just be annoying because i'd have to tell people in person that it was 
Free for them to share.

OK, so Frank says distribution must be allowed without any 
charges, and you say that you may charge for distribution.

You're actually both right.  You can charge for distribution, but 
you can't forbid the people to which you distribute from either 
giving it away or charging if they choose to distribute it 
further, so long as they follow the terms of the license.  So 
you can charge 5 grand for your GPL'ed code, but your client is 
then free to give it to all his competitors.

What makes the GPL useful for those of us writing commercial 
software in certain vertical markets is that our clients don't 
tend to want to share with their competitors.  But it pretty 
much eliminates the "you must pay me 5 grand for each and every 
machine you install it on" model favored by most proprietary 
software vendors.  It's pretty much "site license or nothing", 
which customers tend to like better anyway as long as it's not 
cost prohibitive.

I really don't know how to apply the GPL literally to music, or 
if it's even desirable to do so.  I think that's why we have so 
many competing free music licenses out there already.

Rob

For "CD" read "Linux Distribution boxed set" and that happens all the
time. There is money to be made by selling just because the product is
there in front of the customer, conveniently available right now. It the
same logic that makes me buy a CD I want in the shop even though I could
go home and order it cheaper through Amazon.

Hallo,


Did I say ANYWHERE that it would not allow that? Did you see the
"only" I wrote above? And the "every copy" and the "distribution must
be allowed"?

Have YOU read MY words? Do you pay Linus Thorwalds for every one of
your kernel?  Would you be able to use Linux freely, if you had to?
No, you wouldn't and that is because the GPL does not put any
(monetary) restrictions on the distribution of the kernel. 

Yes, you may charge, but no, you're not obliged to. That's all I'm
telling here for days, so please stop putting words in my mouth I
didn't say. 

(sorry for getting impatient)

Hi all,

I've just purchased a Soundblaster Live Platinum 5.1 w/Live Drive. I've
got it all set up and working with the ALSA drivers but I am having
trouble with JACK and the .asoundrc file. I want to be able to have
multiple in/out ports. Example, I want to be able to use jackEQ and send
the master output to speakers, and the monitor output out to headphones.

Does anyone have a same .asoundrc file or can give me tips on how to set
it up? I've tried reading the ALSA docs but am not having much luck.

Thanks,

Hi.

I'm confused about whether or not I have a low-latency kernel, and if not why 
not. I installed the multimedia kernel and booted into it but:

[root@olaf joe]# cat /proc/version

[root@olaf joe]# cat /proc/sys/kernel/lowlatency
cat: /proc/sys/kernel/lowlatency: No such file or directory

Does this definitely mean I don't have low-latency? Any ideas why not? Can't 
identify anything relevant in /var/log/messages.

Does /proc/sys/kernel/lowlatency relate to the pre-emption patches or Andrew 
Morton's low-latency patches or both or what?

Thanks for any help.

It definetly relates to the low-level patches. I first compiled a kernel
with LL patches only. The patch creates a ioctl in 
/proc/sys/kernel/lowlatency

which can be used as documented.

I have the preemptable patches installed now, too. I don't knwo how to
control these though.. The capabilities you can check by installing
liubcap and reconfiguring then recompiling jackd. the use your usual
jackd -R .. line with s/jackd/jackstart.

Of course. like Robert Jonsson said, this happens only when the ioctl

So,

I have this HDSP/Multiface and all the Alsa drivers I could want, but when I use mplayer for anything I may as well be watching a rice krispies commercial.  The video is fine when the sound is off, but if the sound is on, the video and audio both jump and snap and crackle.  I turn it off before it gets to pop...  is there anything special I can do?  Do I need to recompile mplayer with or without some special flag, or is there some option I can simply run when I bring up the program?

Thanks,

Hello all !

What could I do about the following problem ?

I have an M-audio delta66 + omni I/O (preamp/breakout box). This card
has an onboard digital mixer that allows hardware monitoring of inputs.

- when setting this mixer to directly route a HW input to a PCM output,
the sound is perfectly fine. The signal goes through both an A/D and a
D/A conversion before reaching my ears. I suppose that if I had a ground
loop problem (or other analog noise source), I would hear it with such a
setup. 

- now, when using jackd to route (with no jack client in between) the
alsa capture port associated with the HW input to a playback port, the
sound is full of horrible "blips".

I use :

- IRQ #10 for the delta66 (I even disabled the USB controller of the
  motherboard which used IRQ#11, with no better results).
- a patched for LL 2.4.19 kernel, ext2 filesystems and hdparm'ed HDs.
- alsa 0.9.6
- a tmpfs work directory for jackd that I start with '-R' as root.

How could I isolate the source of this very annoying problem ?

Is there a way to route an input to an output through ALSA only without
using jackd (and the hw mixer too of course) ? Maybe that would help
tracking down the culprit ...

I'd appreciate any hint on this. Thanks a lot !

Hi,
All Mandrake mm kernels have at least the low latency and pre-emption
patch, and the version you are running (2.4.22-21mdk) also has the
sched(0) patch.

I'm not sure I'm following this.  How have you got envy24control set
up?  Are H/W Out 1/2 set to PCM Out 1/2 or Digital Mix L/R?  I've had a
problem that sounds similar when using the Digital Mix L/R combo.  I
found that muting all of the channels except PCM Out 1/2 cleared it up. 
I think it was that PCM Out 1/2 were being overdriven.

On 02 Nov 2003 09:48:44 -0600


I hear no noise when I set H/W Out 1/2 the right H/W In (straight input
monitoring) or when I set H/W Out 1/2 the Digital Mixer (after unmuting
and raising the level of the input channel of course).

Bad noise comes when I set H/W Out 1/2 to PCM Out 1/2 and connect using
jackd the alsa capture port (that map to a H/W In) to the alsa playback
port 1/2 (that maps to PCM Out 1/2).

Is this a better description ?

I've just upgraded my kernel to 2.4.22+ll and alsa to 0.9.8 but this did
not change the situation.


Thanks for answering.

David, how exactly dows this mapping take place?  Via a command line?
A jack patchbay?  Routing in a particular program?  or with the
envy24control GUI?  Detailing the steps you take to set this up may
prove helpful.

I recall having this happen when I had the Omni (long since upgraded
to a Delta 1010).  I think there was some sort of monitoring or source
button I had to push on the Onmi box to stop this.  The noise, if it's
what I'm thinking of, is the digital equivalent of a feedback loop.

By default, jackd maps its "alsa_pcm:capture_1" port to the "H/W In 1" 
input of the soundcard and its "alsa_pcm:playback_1" port to
the "PCM Out 1" of the soundcard.

I connected these two jack ports using qjackconnect, I guess I could do
the same with jack_connect. 

With envy24control's "Patchbay/Router", I chose "PCM Out 1" to be
heard on "H/W Out1" so that I can hear what jackd is spitting in 
"alsa_pcm:playback_1".

I this a little bit clearer ? Sorry for being confusing.


On the Omni itself ? I don't think I have such a button.


Thanks.

ok I think you might be confusing things a little bit here...

hfsplus is going to help you only if you take the hard drive out of your 
mac and put it into your pc. hfsplus is a filesystem. What you're 
dealing with here is a network protocol. so:

These are the filesystems that a local machine would use on it's hard 
drives.
Filesystems:
Windows: Fat32 and NTFS
Linux: ext2,ext3, ReiserFS, XFS, JFS (oh and it can read NTFS, Fat32, 
and HFS/HFS+)
MacOS: HFS, HFS+

The network Protocols (SMB, AFS) are what we use access filesystems 
across the network.
So if you're accessing files on your Mac from your Linux box, you can 
use NFS or SMB. If you are accessing files on your Linux box from your 
Mac then you can use AFS(appletalk), SMB, or NFS.

Ok so this is pretty confusing. What I'm trying to say is that to talk 
the network protocols (AFS,SMB,NFS) you don't need the filesystem 
support for the other system (HFS+, or NTFS in a windows situation.) 
because everyone is talking the network protocol.

Ok so here we go. Nice and simple.

I'm on my mac. I want to copy files from my linux machine. if I have 
samba installed on my linux machine, I can use samba.

apple-k (open up the Open Servers dialog)
smb://ipaddressoflinuxmachine

then you authenticate and go from there.

you can also install netatalk on Linux and use the AFS (appletalk) 
protocol to connect to the linux box.

apple-k
afp://ipaddressoflinuxmachine

ok so now I'm on my linux machine. I want to connect to the mac:
enable windows sharing on your mac.

then in KDE Konqueror or in Nautilus type in:
smb:///ipaddresstomac

it will authenticate you and you should be able to copy stuff over.

I won't discuss NFS, because I don't like it. It's a pain.

I've used appletalk over the last two and a half years, and I have never 
seen any problems. It seriously just works. I even setup a music server 
for my universities music library using linux and netatalk when they 
couldn't afford mac OS X server.

So good luck.

Art




-->><<--__-->><<--

	Yes.  I believe Joe is correct - it sounds like a feedback loop to me. 
Why are you connecting these?  If you want to monitor in real time just
set HW Out 1/2 to Digital Mix L/R.


Jan





-->><<--__-->><<--


Yes, I'm using qjackctl, but all I have is capture_1, capture_2,
playback_1, playback_2. I've got it set to hw:0, but these are the only
ports I get.

I wanted to play a guitar through jack-rack and I heard this noise. Did
it come from jack-rack, a ladspa plugin, jackd, alsa, the soundcard ?
This is why I tried to isolate the problem, ending with a very simple
setup : jackd connects the input channel to the output channel PCM Out 1
assigned to H/W Out 1 (with the "PatchBay/Router" in envy24control). I
still get the noise.

I don't have this problem when doing true hardware monitoring of the
input : be it by assigning H/W In 1 to H/W Out 1 (with the
"Pathbay/Router") or by assigning Digital Mixer L to H/W Out 1 (with
the"Patchbay/Router") and unmuting/raising the slider of channel H/W
In 1 with the "Monitor Mixer" pane in envy24control.


Thanks.

I thought that _ought_ to be the case but I was suspicious because of the 
/proc/sys/kernel/lowlatency thing and also because I get very noticeable 
audio dropouts when I do things like task-switch. jackd doesn't report xruns 
though.

Am I correct in thinking that if I start jackd as root I don't need to use -R 
or jackstart or anything to get good performance? At the moment I think I'm 
using jackd -d alsa -d hw:0 -p 512 (although that's in a script on my other 
PC so I might be mis-remembering).

Cheers.

A couple of suggestions for narrowing the problem down further:

1. Record something (ideally something easy to see and hear problems with - such as an oscillator) via alsa, without jack
2. Record the same signal with jack
3. Examine the waveforms visually

If the recorded waveforms look garbled:

4. Post a small fragment or two on a web server
5. Pass along the URL so we have something more precise than "the
sound is full of horrible "blips"." ;)

If the recorded waveforms look okay:

4. Play the recordings via alsa
5. Play the recordings via jack

This should help identify where the problem is.

No, it's the other way around. -R is only available when you run as root,=

with "root capabilities".=20
It is not possible to get good performance without running with -R.

Yeah, I dunno why Danny made it that way.  I think just to make sure
lowlat was enabled by default with that kernel.


The #1 best thing you can do is mount /tmp as tmpfs.  See the jack
homepage.  It makes all the difference.  Also, if you are using KDE,
Mandrake has this stupid idea of renicing X to -10, which makes the mm
kernel very stop-and-go.  Adjust the -n level to 0 in
/etc/X11/xdm/Xservers.  If you're using gdm (as all sane people do), you
don't have to worry, X is not reniced by gdm.


With the mm kernel, you should install jack-realtime, and start jack as
a normal user with 'jackstart'.  That's part of the mm kernel's purpose.

Try using qjackctl too.  It lets you adjust all the jack parameters and
compare the performance.

Hello all:

I am looking for advice on using a Shure sm57 microphone directly into the mic 
input of a Creative sbawe64 gold soundcard. I am using an impedance matching 
XLR to 1/8" adapter and I have raised the "capture" level in the mixer.

To record anything (say using arecord) I have to crank up the mic-in level to 
full and the result is that I get a lot of hiss and the signal is still 
pretty quiet.

Do I need an external preamplifier to use the sm57? If so where can I go to 
find one or schematics to build one? 

Or is there a simpler way?

Thank you for any suggestions,
Paul




-->><<--__-->><<--
i dont know if this helps much but i have an sm58 and find i have to 
both boost the signal on the mixer and use the preamps on my quattro to 
get a good level.....

In most cases, I'd say yes.  Unless your soundcard happens to have a
very good amplifier system and you're recording something loud (i.e.
a guitar amp on 11), a cheap-o mixer is probably your best bet
(Behringer stufff gives you great bang for the buck).  A tube preamp
isn't a bad idea, and you can get the Art OPL for around %60

I think that's a popular interpretation of the GPL, but in fact I 
think you only have to distribute source code to those parties that

Red Hat tm Enterprise AS Premium costs US $2499-$18000 for one year

Yes, indirectly. He is paid by OSDL to work on the kernel, so every 
time you buy a product from a member of the OSDL consortium you are 
doing exactly that.


Sure, but a kernel by itself isn't much use to most people, which is 
why only complete systems (or distributions as we've come to call 
them) are commercially viable.


That's the case with any transaction. In the context of musicians, I 
envisage that (since the majority never make a decent living from 
their music) most would use a libre music system if it meant that 
their music was heard and appreciated by more people. 

Removing money from the transaction would probably benefit most 
musicians - ok, they'd still have to fund production by themselves, 
but they wouldn't have to spend thousands of euros or dollars on 
promotion, for example sending CD's to record labels, radio stations 
and music journalists that would probably drop most of them straight 
in the rubbish bin. 

The way the music business is structured at the moment, promotion for 
an up-and-coming band probably costs far more then album production. 
As paradoxical as it may seem, you need to pay for a video to get on 
mainstream radio in the UK now, and there are also 'buy-ons', where 
bands pay for the privilege of touring with more established artists. 
Then there's the cost of arranging publicity, and playing for free 
when everyone else still has to be paid. 

But what about that minority of musicians who do have a commercial 
hit? We need to build safeguards into libre music licensing for them, 
just as RMS built safeguards into the GPL against the exploiters who 
were moving in on his world. Otherwise, we might as well put 
everything - software and music - into the public domain, and trust 
that unfettered human nature will produce the right result.  

Cheers

1. Yes. The mic input on soundcards (especially consumer ones) is really
only for voice recording using an electret mic that has quite high
output. Contrary to another answer, I'd say the SM57 is low output, 
certainly compared with any condenser mic.

2a. MidiMan (M-Audio?) Audio Buddy is the entry level and gives excellent 
results.

2b. As suggested, the mic channels of a Mackie VLZ mixer gives exceptional
bang for buck if you think you'll ever need more than 2 mic channels, or if
you'll ever want proper (48V) phantom power, or have a use for a small
workhorse mixer. The Mackies seem to have lower noise than most mixers
at the low-cost end of the market.

You should then be able to use the line input of your sound card,
connected to the preamp output. On the Mackie mixer use the channel
insert point, which is a TRS jack, tip = send. In fact a standard mono
1/4" jack will do the Right Thing as long as you don't want any mic
signal on the mix bus.

Bear in mind that your sound card line input is stereo, so you can either
connect the preamp to both L and R inputs, or just to one input and take
care to ignore the other one in case it contributes extra noise.

Thanks Austin! This tip has solved a long-running Audacity 'bug' for 
me, which I couldn't figure out. I wasn't seeing it on my 
gdm/blackbox studio machine, but my kdm/kde/blackbox office machine 
was always affected, no matter which IRQ the soundcard was on or how 
many different builds of Audacity I tried. Both were running 
otherwise similar Mandrake 9.1 installations.

For the record, with n set to -10 I got consistent skip-forwards of 
the Audacity cursor during playback, whenever I moved the mouse. 
That's why I was thinking it was an IRQ problem, but it persisted 
even with optimised IRQs (10 for the soundcard, 11 for the network 
card, 12 for the mouse.) 

I was able to replicate this on two very different hardware machines 
running kdm, so other Mandrake 9.1/Audacity users must have been 
affected. I'll post the fix to the Audacity lists.

Cheers!

Hi,

If you're serious about "professional" grade preamps,
Tape Op published an article describing preamps. It
included schematics and kits for assembly, just in
case you don't want to do all the work. These are
vacume tube solutions that cost about $400.00 US per
channel but are in the quality range of $1,000.00
devices produced by companies like Avalon.

Sorry, I don't recall the title of the article, or the
publishing date. Perhaps you can find it on their

interesting publication for the DIY types. I mention
this because I've noticed there's a couple DIY'ers on

Hooray for TapeOp! I personally think this is the best magazine on real
recording of all of them out there. I love it. The only magazine I really
relish.

If you don't receive it, get it. It's free. No reason not too, and you'll
have a great time.

Cheers,

Only in the USA with 3rd-class postage (whatever that means). Outside 
the USA it's US $45 for six issues.

True. All countries have different deals like this. I'm sorry you cannot get
it for free where you are.

TapeOp did do a book compiling some early stuff

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0922915601/qid%3D998546836/sr%3D2-5/r
ef%3Daps%5Fsr%5Fb%5F2%5F2/104-0011666-1453529

I haven't read it, so this is not a personal recommendation, but the two
reviews on this page reflect what I really like about the magazine. It has
much less to do with just the latest equipment a lot more to do with the
people and how they work.

Since you can get the book for something like $15, it seems like a good
start.

The latest issue of TapeOp had a good article on sub-group compression. I've
been trying this for 2-3 weeks now and I like how it's working so far,
although I wish I had a better arsenal of outboard compressors. Ron probably
gets to do this sort of stuff far more than I.

Mark

Hey all,

	Noticed the Phase88 in the new Musician's Friend catalog - very,
very attractive price for such a loaded interface.  I have two
questions:

1) Is it supported under ALSA?  I've done a bit of research and it's
difficult to find anything on the Phase88.  It looks almost exactly like
the EWS88 MT, straight down to the layout of the breakout A/D conversion
box.  In fact, a post on RAP hints that it might just be a rebranding:
http://groups.google.com/groups?q=terratec+phase+88+group:rec.audio.pro&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&selm=gprvcvk8o6nisk3qjfhgpm2gp1cfc2hms1%404ax.com&rnum=1 

2) Does it sound decent?  I'm currently using an M-Audio Delta44 and
dying to get more channels.  This is much cheaper than a Delta1010.  If
I had the cash now to drop on a 1010, I'd do it, since I know the
M-Audio stuff rocks.  I've been unable to find any reviews online, web
or Usenet.

Thanks!

Okay, I know everyone has been itching for a really bad song, written in
ten minutes, and recorded in less than twenty, about the new kernel, so
here it is:
http://groundstate.ca/twopointsix.ogg

Of course this was done wholly with free software:
Mandrake cooker
kernel 2.6-test9 courtesy of Olivier Blin
audacity 1.2.0pre3
a crappy intel sound card
an expensive condenser mic
a roland Sound Canvas MIDI module and an Evolution controller

Now if only I could get my Quattro working and learn to play keys a bit
better, I would wet my pants...

Well, with the 2.6 kernel I get this:

It's been reported before though.

With 2.4, it works okay, but jackd keeps quitting at strange times with
some sort if IO CTL borken pipe error for no obvious reason.  I forget
the exact error right now.  It's been mentioned once or twice on the alsa
list, but no suggestions yet.

It's been a long hard road with this device.

Yeah. One day it might actually be possible to use all four channels at

lately it has become impossible.

crazy tunes, I've got a linux only composition up on my website, I
recently sold all my hardware and am now working on all my new tunes
using just linux, at the moment with csound. Csound is fascinating
'cause you can distribute the "source code" of the compostion along with

hi all...

just wondering if there are any Zaurus users on the list - the older 
version not the new one...

i've seen one in action and i know its got good media player facilities 
- some kind of xmms i seem to recall?... but im curious as to what else 
will run on it...

thinking about getting one as a replacement to the laptop i thoroughly 
destroyed yesterday. dropped it from a bench, shattered screen and 
damaged motherboard. i'll be lucky if i get the data back. compaq 
armada's are flimsy things - if it had been the Dell i used to have, 
chances are it might have been salvagable....

thankx

I have one. 


Yes I guess it can to xmms. It also runs OpieMedia player (in OpenZaurus anyway) that is based on
libxine. So it can also play divx movie files and stuff also.
You can install csounds on it. But there are not to many programs for
creating multimedia on it. Don't experct to do any realtime stuff with
csounds on the zaurus. You can render it and then listen to it. Even as
root user my 5500 sounds real choppy when trying to play a sine wave a
44.1k 16bit in real time with csounds. 

check out zaurus software index and decide for your self. (I mostly use
it for the calender features, address, todo, and checkbook apps):

Hi All,

I'm considering buying a secondhand M-Audio Quattro. There are plenty of
them popping up on ebay all the time. The problem is I live in Australia
and the quattro uses an external power supply - does anyone know if a
Quattro bought in the US can be made to work on Australia's 240V mains
power - either through an adaptor or a different power supply?

Cheers,

Hello list!

I'm having some trouble with burning CD's and having trouble finding sources
of info - I don't know if I'm just not looking very hard or well, or if I'm
really getting stuck

basically, right now on my system, they end up being coasters about 90% of
the time - I've been trying both cdrecord and xcdroast and both either do
the burn (i've tried burning iso files for backups and also doing audio cds)
or they'll have some sort of error, fixate, and eject the disk early in the
process

I assume this is an issue with the hardware, I guess - I have an artec 52x
burner

other than this I don't have all that much info at my fingertips (I'm at the
wrong computer) - but I'm trying to find stuff to start reading, checking,
etc...

any ideas would be appreciated!  thanks!

Check with cdrecord -scanbus to be sure your  scsi cd devices.

Read man cdrecord.  Examples at the end will help you.

Check your CD writer maximum write speed.  If you are having troubles, 
reduce writing speed.
To make a backup to a CD use mkisofs.  Read man mkisofs.  Check examples 
in cdrecord man pages.

To write audio cds try to save just wav files under a directory. 
Cdrecord will remove headers.  See also cdrecord examples.

A slower speed is... slower... but... It works!.

how long have you had your burner?.....
mine is pooping out thesedays after a lot of wear and tear and im 
getting about the same ratio of coasters too.

the other thing i'm guessing at is that maybe cdrecord / xcdroast arent 
compatible with 52x burners?....

mine's real brand spankin' new




now this is an interesting theory - ties into the other guy's suggestion of
burning slower.  I'd bet that would work if not being compatible with 52x
was the problem

I did notice stuff like, on xcdroast, it would go to write the first track
and just apparentely haul ass - it would report that it was burning at like
243x - like WHOA slow down there cheeko!  maybe forcing a certain speed
(slower than 52x) would prevent this from happening

   I don't burn much on Linux jsut because the tools seem much more

Well, I have a 5500 and a client of mine has a 5600. The 5600 has 
a processor that's about twice as fast, comes back from sleep 
much more nicely, and has a little built in speaker (as opposed 
to the 5500 where you have to use the headphone jack to hear 
anything beyond keyclick.) The 5500 is also half as much though. 
I'm still using the stock ROM (not Opie) so I haven't 
experimented much with composition (I'm thinking a tracker type 
of thing or maybe timidity would be the best i could hope for) 
nor with music recording (I think I'd rather use my notebook 
plus UA-30 for signal acquisition than the little headphone jack 
on the Z.)

I think if I were going to spend more than 200 bucks on a PDA I'd 
go all the way and get the C750/760 (sort of like a linux tablet 
PC, only the size of a zaurus.) But the 5600 is already a 
potentially faster machine than my last laptop.... so it should 
at least handle some rudimentary software mixing and sample 
playback.

I have a 52x32x52x LG writer, these are my experiences:

- Depending on your version of cdrecord, you'd better have ide-scsi 
emulation (some models are supported already via ATAPI)
- Also make sure you have the burner on the PRIMARI bus of your IDE 
channel (I have mine as primary and my DVD as secondary, both on ide-scsi)
- Try using cdrdao also (XCDRoast is more like a *frontend* for cdrecord 
*and* cdrdao, but depending on the options selected it will use either 
one or the other).
- Depending on your distro, you may have real trouble to make you CD 
writer work as a regular user (without you needing to change a ton of 
perms, that is), RH is especially difficult here (but still possible, if 
you like check this post I made over at 
http://www.slackercentral.com/forums/showthread.php?t=47869, I there 
post about how to obtain user access to the writer.
- Another way may be to check this script I wrote as an excersise:
#!/bin/bash
# Image grabing script.

while :
do
echo "Warning, this program uses cdrdao for image making!"
echo "You will need either a true SCSI drive or SCSI emulation"
echo "on EIDE-ATAPI drives, if you want to konw how your devices"
echo "are mapped on the SCSI bus, you may want to see the contents"

I've had success in dealing with some burning problems by running :

hdparm -d1 -X34 /dev/hdc

.. of course, replacing /dev/hdc with whatever your CD drive is. It appears 
some burners don't like full DMA. That said, I was able to burn audio CD's on 
my burner with full DMA enable, but couldn't burn data CD's without running 
the above command.

I also religiously use the ide-scsi layer, but that can be a bit tricky to set 
up.

My burner reads at 52x, writes up to 8x.  It is a LG.
I usually write at 4x or 3x.
I was trying to create an audio CD trying to recover a very scratched 
CD.  Grip very slowly has recovered all tracks after some extra cleanning.
I was trying to write with:

cdrecord -v speed=2 dev=0,0,0 -pad   *.wav

And it was returning with error.

Then I added -dao:
cdrecord -v speed=2 -dao dev=0,0,0 -pad   *.wav

Now, it is working... It is burning track 7 so far.

Its 120v input and 9v output, and adaptor would most likely work well
with it, since you just need one to step down the 240v input to 120v, so

I use it, but what I need to do is cross compile oggenc, so I can write
out a wav file from csound and then convert it to an ogg and then play
back with ogg123 so I don't have to leave the terminal.

You can go on the web with it, I haven't tried writing out a super huge
file yet, but I'm going to try to write one to the sd card and see how
that goes.




-->><<--__-->><<--
WIth the 5500 the best bet is to do everything from the terminal, but
I've also read that performance is a lot better with openzaurus, I was
just having a lot of trouble getting openzaurus to flash onto my 5500,
and I tried to run the upgrade and had trouble flashing that as well,
but I like using the terminal and apache/mysql works as well, and it
also makes a cool ebook reader with the guttenberg reader, and there's
also a couple of good graphics programs.

Csound has one problem, you need to really use the zaurus plugged into
the power supply and then turn off the "supsend", so that it doesn't go
to sleep in the middle of compiling a piece.

The ones in RH9 are, but I can only get 48x media, and some drives dont
like reading it when its been burned at 52x. Dropping the speed to 16x or
so is much more reliable.

Hello,

I believe this will give you an audio CD that will have 2 seconds of
silence inbetween the tracks, which will be very annoying if the tracks
have been designed to continue smoothly. (Though I am not sure what
cdrecord -dao actually does)

What I do in such a case is using cdparanoia (I think grip does use
cdparanoia under the hood, but I just prefer command line tools for this
kind of batch jobs, and I like to adjust cdparanoia's settings) to
extract the individual wav files. Then I use

$ cdrdao read-toc --device X,Y,Z foo.toc

to extract the table of contents from the original cd, edit the toc file
by hand to use the individual wav files (changing the FILE lines, 
changing "data.wav" to "trackXX.wav" for each file, and changing the time
offset (the first time parameter after each filename) to 0:00:00), and
than I write it to disc with

$ cdrdao write --device foo.toc

(depending on your device, you may need to specify the driver)

Maybe there is an easier way to do this - I guess cdparanoia could extract
all files to 1 single wav file, but this way I can convert to wav files do
mp3/ogg as well.

As a side effect, your copy will have a valid CDDB ID as well :-)

It seems to work fine if I use -n 4 or greater.  Why do you choose 3?

Also, I'm trying to adapt the .asoundrc to use hw:1, becuase Mandrake's
hardware manager forces my internal soundcard to hw:0.  Obviously there
are just some changes from "card 0" to "card 1", but do I have to modify
the pcm.quattro, pcm.q4, and pcm.q4b sections?

More is always better, but jackd runs without complaint alongside Hydrogen,

My mistake - the second one I'm talking about here is xdm, not gdm. 
gdm is the display/login manager that comes with GNOME - it asks you 
for your username, then the password box comes up after that.

Still, this bug only affects users of kdm, it seems. You're probably 
running kdm if you've installed a KDE desktop as the default. It 
still happens even if you are running a desktop other than KDE, eg 
Blackbox, if you've logged in via kdm. It affects machines with both 
standard and multimedia kernels.

To recap, Austin's fix for the skipping Audacity cursor is:

Adjust the -n level from -10 to 0 in the file /etc/X11/xdm/Xservers so 
the last line looks like this:

:0 local /bin/nice -n 0 /usr/X11R6/bin/X -deferglyphs 16

If someone could add this to the Audacity FAQ, I'd appreciate it.

Cheers

Daniel

Thanks now Audacity is up and running. I had been trying the whole day

to add dependencies with the suffix -devel. The only one I couldn't find

. But maybe that's the reason the GUI doesn't show up in some buttons.

Hi,

Jackd also freezes my machine when using my usb interface (emi 2|6) and
passing the -R flag.  I think this is an known issue with jack and usb
devices, for all intents and purposes jack with various usb cards is
useless currently.  Some apps seem to work fine for me too.

totally freezes up.

Probably but IIUC the -n flag gives higher latency so the lower you can 
set it the better.


Yes. It is written for the first device so you need to change those 
values to hw:1,0 etc...


No problem.

This doesn't happen for me.

I use jack + quattro with a celeron 1 Ghz pIII, ASUS microATX mobo, 512 
MB RAM, sis630 VGA.

kernel-2.4.21-ll
usb-ohci.
gcc-2.95.4
enlightenment-0.16.x
alsa-driver-0.9.4 (Jul 31 2003 cvs)
jackd-0.90 tarball which Paul made because I cannot compile cvs for some 
reason.

I can run for hours without dropouts as root with:

jackd -v -R -a -d alsa -d quattro2 -p 1024 -n 3 -zt

(I cannot actually use alsa as a normal user on this machine but I never 
want to anyway. ;)

I wouldn't say the jack driver is useless for me. In fact I just 
realised that even though I get spurious amounts of error messages:

late driver wakeup: nframes to process = 2048.

with -n 4 I can run all four channels without obvious playback errors 
and with only a couple of dropouts for a simple 10 second record test in 
ardour (while also running alsaplayer). However my computer has issues 
with changing virtual desktops while running jackd so this crashed after 
about two minutes. Straight after I changed desktops though.

Running with -n 3 and recorded for 7 minutes before jackd shutdown. The 
sound quality is poorer (very obvious crackling and pops) but I didn't 
switch desktops.

This time I prevented a hard reboot by alt+sysreq+e , alt+sysreq+i. BTW 
I also experience the problem of jackd not accepting ^C in the term with 
this version.

Running with -n 6 the sound quality is much cleaner. I was able to 
listen to the previous 7 minutes then record for another 2 before jackd 
died. Trying again I was able to record for about 9 minutes before jackd 
crashed. Luckily, this time I was able to ^C out :/

This is what the output from jack looks like:

---------
load = 11.0997 max usecs: 2507.000, spare = 20712.000
late driver wakeup: nframes to process = 2048.

The load = 10.8494 max usecs: 2461.000, spare = 20758.000 messages are 
almost exactly equally spaced until the last one where we get

late driver wakeup: nframes to process = 3072.

jackd seems to be happy as long as the late driver wakeup doesn't exceed 
3072. Maybe this could be enforced somehow to make a simple fix for USB 
devices. Although I would rather see the complete solution implemented. 
(hint hint nudge nudge).

$ cdr *.wav

What's difficult about that?
(it took a little time to figure out what to put in cdr, but it's only
a one line shell script)

This looks like it could be a speed problem - certainlly reducing the
speed should show whether or not that's the case. On my CDR burning
system I then found two major improvements I could make:
(a) tweaking the HD performance with hdparm
(b) turning on burnproof feature, which has to be done explicitly with
cdrecord and I must agree isn't obvious how to do it -
driveropts=burnproof, which you find out by RTFM and trying
-checkdrive driveropts=help

The info I found on AMX is that it is a control interface (LED) so it 
probably requires a way of writing data in the correct way and sending 
it to the midi port.

Is this correct?

If so it may understand the mmc/mmx protocol. In that case ardour has 
basic support for these.

If it is a completely different language then you should ask on LAD 
where their are more technicallly dexterous people reading.

Dear Patrick.

AMX is complete controlller package.
It's terribly complex.
to keep you updated on this a bit here goes.
ivie  (  i had spelled it wrong ) is also in on this.
the project is to control a system that's in the suites in the 
new jacksonville arena.they have extron switcher, ivie mixer
television set controls vcr and dvd controls.
Unfortunately.. extron has a system .. ivie has a system and all this
will result in a very complex code to have all those working.
the delay being really  short ( wednesday it's got to be online ) 
im kind of really nervous since the equipment is not even plugged in 
so i can test the installation before it's being brought online :)) 
talk about pressure 8)

Thanks for the report, Patrick.  I added your comments above as a

problem might be fixed in current CVS.  I don't know, he still has not
told us what version of JACK he is using.

BTW, Mantis allows anyone interested in a problem to monitor that bug
report.  You get e-mail whenever bugnotes or status changes happen.


I suspect that what you are seeing is the continual latency slippage
as the USB cycle gets more and more out of sync with the JACK cycle.

The solution that has been discussed should address this.  It is
non-trivial to implement, so I don't want to start messing with the
buffer management again until we finish repairing the damage from the
last set of changes in that area.

With all the complaints we've heard about USB block size problems, I
am surprised that so far no one has opened a Mantis feature request to
get it resolved.  Would you be willing to do that?

Hello,
I  am new to this list.
I am getting a make error whenever I  try to compile libhydrogen-0.8.0
 Here is what I get:

alsa -0.9.2
jack-audio-connection-kit-0.80.0
hydrogen/libhydrogen-0.8.0
SB-Live! soundcard
distro: lfs-4.0

also,  Is there any command I can ive to check and make sure jack is working?
I don't have any   Jack-Aware apps installed that I know of - yet =)
 thank  you

try using the standard command line to start jack:

if nothing happens, then jack isn't working....

I also had jack-related trouble when I tried to build 0.8.0.  My solution was 
to grab the CVS version:

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous-CZy7tVeV0kv+F7Cq6hUZDNHuzzzSOjJt@public.gmane.org:/cvsroot/hydrogen login

cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous-CZy7tVeV0kv+F7Cq6hUZDNHuzzzSOjJt@public.gmane.org:/cvsroot/hydrogen co hydrogen

cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous-CZy7tVeV0kv+F7Cq6hUZDNHuzzzSOjJt@public.gmane.org:/cvsroot/hydrogen co 
libhydrogen

The CVS version also has a number of significant improvements over the last 
official release, including better jack functionality.

This is not necessary in this case.  When you first start it up, Hydrogen 
automatically connects itself to the default jack output pair.  As of the 
latest CVS update, this behavior can be turned on and off in the preferences 
dialog.

I think the recommended version of wxGTK for building Audacity is 
still 2.4.0, but Mandrake usually tries to give you the latest of 
everything. You can get around this by building wxGTK 2.4.0 from 
source instead of using the RPMs - it's not at all a difficult build.

You need to install libtool, or it's not in your system path because the

Hello,

thanks THAC i have managed to make jack run smooth enough to take a step
beyond mere experimenting with audio on Linux.

I got muse 0.6 , ams, ZynaddSubFX and ardour Beta running ok but i miss
a Sampler/Drummachine, since i fail to compile hydrogene i would be very
thankfull for any hint towards Mandrake 9.1 - RPMs containing some
Softsampler / Drumbox that can be jacked.

best regards

I'd suggest keep trying with hydrogen. It's very nice and easy to use.
I'm using hydrogen and jack both from CVS, both from a few weeks ago
(jackd version 0.83.5, hydrogen version 0.8.1beta4) and they work great.

one complaint with hydrogen - the drum kits available all seem to
be 44.1khz samples, and it doesn't resample them if you run jackd at
48khz so the drum pitches all seem a bit too high.

Eventually SWAMI/FluidSynth and any MIDI sequencer will be usable.

Hello,

I am pretty new to this.  I have ardour//low latency//jack all working.  I 
have a few samples of drums, etc that I play around with, etc.   It works 
really well, etc. 

What is the next step?  Where can I get more samples to play with?  Is there a 
good program I can use to make my own samples?  I tried using 
SpiralSynthModular, but it crashed a lot, and I couldn't figure out how to 
get anything other than a tunable buzz out of it.  

Any help would be appreciated.  




-->><<--__-->><<--

If you like Spiral I'd recommend checking out ZynAddSubFX , 
http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net . It doesn't crash a lot (at least not for 
me) and sounds really neat, IMHO. It's also easy to create waves with.

I have to agree - I'm a big fan of hydrogen.  The CVS version is also 
substantially better than the rpms, IMHO.  Amongst other things, it gives you 
separate jack outputs for each drum channel, and support for 32 voices 
instead of 16 (also, you could now support any number of voices by changing a 
#define in one line of code, and rebuilding).


Pitch-shifting abilities were recently introduced into the audio engine.  
Sample rate awareness can't be far behind....

-->><<--__-->><<--

Correcting myself: MusE works quite well with Jack right now in many cases, 
but MusE:s internal synths and Jack doesn't seem like the best combination. 
MusE and fluidsynth works very well (at least for me) when using MusE with 
alsa output, but then it's kind of difficult to use other Jack-apps like 
ZynAdd...

I recorded some dozen sounds from Alesis D4 by just recording them as

serve great (at least, they *sound* great, i just have to get this
hydrogene-app to arrange them ...)

Isn't an Alesis just a synth with a Drum Module?  Sure a nice Korg Keyboard 
Synth, or a 303 and a 909 would work.  I don't have any of those.   

I'd prefer to work in all software anyway.  Is there a difference from using a 
hardware synth, or software emulated synth?    The hardware synth seems like 
a lot more work to setup.

Hallo,



I use my own Pd tools for drums. This is very flexible for my work
style. I seperated several sequencer GUIs from the sound generation.
For sequencing drums I often use my sseq-objects available here:
http://footils.org/cms/?show_article=14

For the drum sounds itself I also use several approaches. One is my Pd
drum "angriff" (http://footils.org/cms/?show_article=13 or extended
here http://mentalfloss.ca/sintheta/html/downloads.html) the other
also involves fluidsynth, but by using the fluid~ external for Pd,
which happens to be also available on my site ;) Maybe these are also
an option, but they require a bit learning of Pd.

I'd echo the recommendations for ZynAddSubFX, and I'd also recommend Hydrogen.  
These two applications, alongside Ardour, make a great combo.

Hi List,

I want to record in 7200 frequency, 8bit, mono. Well the specs may seem
strange but we have a HardWare which understands voice files only with these
specs.
I have 2.4.18-3 linux kernel.
I have intel 810E chipset, with builtin audio card.

lspci returns 
<lspci>
Multimedia audio controller: Intel Corp. 82801AA AC'97 Audio (rev 02)
</lspci>

I too have Sound Blaster Live.
lspci returns
<lspci>
 Multimedia audio controller: Creative Labs SB Live! EMU10k1 (rev 08)
 Input device controller: Creative Labs SB Live! MIDI/Game Port
</lspci>

And we use xwave and soundstudio for recording.

And i have intel audio card under alsa.

Intel Audio Card:
I could record properly in 16 bit, but when i record in 8 bit it gives lot
of noise. I dont know from where it comes.

Sound Blaster Live:
I could record in given specs, but when i play back the bass gets
increased. I mean it dosen't seem to be the same voice anymore.


Can anybody help me.
TIA.

bye.
uday.

Why don't you record in higher quality (the native rate of your soundcard)
and convert it to the lower quality afterwards, with sox? I think the result
will be better.

-->><<--__-->><<--

The short answer is, these specs aren't going to sound good, no matter how you 
get there.  If you take a 16-bit, 48000 signal, and convert it to 8-bit 7200, 
you are throwing away 92.5% of your data.  The result is bound to be a little 
noisy ;)

I don't know exactly what it is that you are recording, but you might be able 
to improve your results slightly by:

1. Making sure you input signal level is as hot as it can get without clipping
2. Recording at the highest quality level supported by your hardware
3. Running the sound through a compressor or (better yet) look-ahead limiter
4. Normalizing the sound
5. Converting down to your final format

I'm not familiar with the programs you're using.  If you can't find 
"Compressor" and "Normalize" in your application, you might want to give 
Audacity a try:

http://audacity.sourceforge.net/

Also, if you've never worked with a compressor before, you might find the 
following helpful:

Good luck!

Hello everyone.

I have a problem with midi timing.. I think I have set up enhanced rtc
correctly and low latency patch on kernel 2.4.20.

When I drive hydrogen (or even the inbuilt soundfont player on my
SBLive) with seq24 or ardour, there is a noticable variation in midi
timing. This was tested by using a run of closed hihats. When I play the
sequence back, the hihats are grouped in batches rather than being
evenly spaced. This was noticable when running as root and when using
alsa and (to a lesser extent) jack. The midi connection is via alsa.

Any hints on what I should do?

Hi,

  I apologize if this question is off-topic for the list, although I
believe this is an appropriate forum.

  I'm looking for a command-line or script-oriented audio compositor. 
Specifically, I'd like to be able to do something like:

audio-composite track1.wav 100 track2.wav 200 > composited.wav

  and audio-composite would generate a new wav file which would consist
of the sounds in track1.wav playing from the 100 second mark, and the
sounds in track2.wav playing from the 200 second mark.  I'm looking for
something driven via the command-line or in a script because I want to
composite close to a hundred different clips with second-accurate
insertion points, so I don't much fancy doing this with the plethora of
gui sound editors that exist.

  I've gone through Freshmeat and the best I've found so far is soxmix's
ability to mix multiple wav files into one: with some appropriate
munging, I could make that do what I want, but I'm hoping to find a tool
built for the job.

  Any help greatly appreciated!

Mammut will FFT your sound in one single gigantic analysis (no windows).
These spectral data, where the development in time is incorporated in
mysterious ways, may then be transformed by different algorithms prior to
resynthesis. An interesting aspect of Mammut is its completely

Hi.

I know this isn't the kind of thing that generally gets discussed on this 
list, but it does kind of relate to linux audio.

I have an hour or so of taped conversation I need to type up. I was planning 
to record it to my hard disk so I can do everything from the keyboard.

What I'd like to be able to do is set up keyboard shortcuts for rewind / pause 
etc that I can use without task-switching out of the wordprocessor.

If I understand correctly one way of doing this would be to set up a global 
keyboard shortcut that runs a program that sends a jack_transport message to 
the audio app. If I had lots of time or a bit more experience I might be 
inclined to set something like that up for the sake of my education, but I 
suspect it would end up taking considerably longer than the typing itself! Is 
there a simpler solution I'm missing?

If anyone has any ideas for an efficient audio-typing system I can use on 
Mandrake 9.2 please let me know.

Thanks.

Thank you all for the quick responses!

to drek holzer: thanks for the info on starting jack, it worked great! =)

to Benjamin Flemming (Benji) : You were right also! The CVS version compiled
without any problems (libhydrogen-0.8.1beta3) =) thanks!

to lee and Comix: I don't know about your suggestions:
^libtool is not installed, or is not in your path:
whereis libtool: /usr/bin/libtool
echo $PATH: /usr:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/qt-3.1.2/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin
 
i tried running ./autogen.sh it didn't work either

Thanks all!
now I need to decide how many versions of qt I want hogging up my disk space
because hydrogen-0.8.1beta3 needs qt-3.2 I know that there is another app that is supposed to work best with 3.1.2 , and I know that hydrogen doesn't consider qt versions backwards compatable ( I tried installing 0.8.0 after I got the libs to work and it complained because qt-3.1.2 was too new! Arrrgh)

On one happy note: there isn't any noise in my system yet! =)

To be more specific and add another vote for ecasound, here is an
example from the ecasound docs at
http://www.wakkanet.fi/~kaiv/ecasound/Documentation/examples.html:

" Cut, copy and paste

   1. ecasound -i bigfile.wav -o part1.wav -t:60.0
   2. ecasound -i bigfile.wav -y:60.0 -o part2.wav

      Here's a simple example where first 60 seconds of bigfile.wav is
written to part1.wav and the rest to part2.wav. If you want to combine
these files back to one big file:

   3. ecasound -i part2.wav -o part1.wav -y:500

      part2.wav is appended to part1.wav "


I'm using this functionality in a shell script that takes 12 ~5 minute 
wav files and concatenates them into 4 ~15 minutes wav files. I'll post
it tonight when I get home from work.

ecasound can also give you the length in seconds (and milliseconds) of a 
file so that you can possible script your insertion points ... I haven't 
figured that out exactly, yet, but believe it can be done by parsing the
output of ecalength (an ecasound tool included with ecasound). There may 
be a cleaner, easier way as well.

have questionable timing when driving the builtin soundfont synth on my
soundcard.. And by the way, hydrogen is by _far_ the best drumloop
sequencer in linux.. I am quite happy to export completed loops as wavs
to use in Muse as a workaround for the time being.

Hello,

This my first post in this list so I introduce myself. I am non-native
english speaker, so forgive me if my english is not correct, I hope at
least it will be understandable ;) About my computer skills I'd say that
I'm an advanced beginner in Linux and *BSD systems, i'm very far to be
expert but I manage to deal with my own problems without much pain now.
I work as a Perl/Python programmer and I slowly learn C/C++. 

For a few days now I've started to explore the world of linux
audio-related software, so I'm a real newbie on this topic. I've played
a little bit with ecasound (i love its concept) and I wonder if there is
a way to control parameters of operators in realtime using software
midi-controllers. If yes, what software to use ? What configuration ? Is
it possible, and how to perform automation in order to replay what was
done manually ?  Any information about how to achive this goal is
welcome.

Thanks.

Mammut will FFT your sound in one single gigantic analysis (no windows).
These spectral data, where the development in time is incorporated in
mysterious ways, may then be transformed by different algorithms prior to
resynthesis. An interesting aspect of Mammut is its completely
non-intuitive sound transformation approach.

Version 2.3.3 of the GPLed musical score editor NoteEdit is available:

http://rnvs.informatik.tu-chemnitz.de/~jan/noteedit/noteedit.html

New features:

	- import MusicXML  

     Thanks to Leon Vinken <leon.vinken-FeDmaE5TyfFmR6Xm/wNWPw@public.gmane.org>

This feature is still experimental. 
Do not expect any compatibility with MusicXML files exported by
Rosegarden. The MusicXML files produced by the Rosegarden sequencer
are incorrect, because:
 - Not every <part> has a corresponding </part>
 - Note types crotchet and minim should be quarter, half etc.
 - MIDI channel numbers in MusicXML range from 1 to 16, Rosegarden starts at 0
 - MIDI program numbers range from 1 to 128, Rosegarden starts at 0
 - The part-name is empty
 - The score-part is empty

Furthermore: There is a undocumented feature : "direct" printing.
Thanks to Jorge <j.windmeisser-VOelKjaoWyriB9QmIjCX8w@public.gmane.org>. This features uses
"abcm2ps" in background to enable quasi direct printing.

Unfortunately, this feature works only if you install NoteEdit
in KDE and "print to file" is not possible.

Use configure option --with-printing to enable this feature.

i had a quite similar problem with muse, i think, there are different
versions of muse-binaries out there either compiled with support for
alsa *or* for jack, AFAIK, there is no commandlineoption to start muse
for jacksupport (such as: muse --jack ) but to type:

#muse --help

wont hurt anyway ;-)

i use thacs muse.rpm for Mandrake 9.1 and as i run it setuid root
without any serious trouble. (muses jacksupport is, in a word: excellent
:-) )

if you compile muse from its sources, it should be possible to turn on
jacksupport by giving the appropriate flag to configure.

good luck

Well, yes, it it. The country produced Chopin, Lutoslawski, and

I'm interested in this, too. I haven't tried it, yet, but, i've read
some of the docs, so I'll try to share what I've learned so far. 
Hopefully someone who has done this will fill in the gaps ....

http://www.wakkanet.fi/~kaiv/ecasound/Documentation/examples.html
has a section "Using controller sources with effects"

Example #4 shows this:
" ecasound -i file.wav -o /dev/dsp -ef3:1000,1.0,1.0 -kos:1,500,2000,1,0 \
-kos:2,0.2,1.0,0.5,0 \
-kx -km:1,0.1,1.5,2,1

      Ok, let's get real whacky. Here a 1Hz sine oscillator is assigned
to the cutoff frequency, while other controller is controlling
resonance. Now we add a MIDI-controller, that controls the second sine
oscillator. "


The ecasound man page:
http://www.wakkanet.fi/~kaiv/ecasound/Documentation/ecasound_manpage.html
has a section on MIDI setup and another on CONTROL ENVELOPE SETUP. Under
the latter is this option:

"-km:fx-param,start-value,end-value,controller,channel

MIDI continuous controller (control change messages). Messages on the
MIDI-channel 'channel' that are coming from controller number
'controller' are used as the controller source. As recommended by the
MIDI-specification, channel numbering goes from 1 to 16. Possible
controller numbers are values from 0 to 127. The MIDI-device where bytes
are read from can be specified using -Md option. Otherwise the default
MIDI-device is used as specified in ~ecasound/ecasoundrc (see
ecasoundrc(5)). Defaults to /dev/midi."


To send CC messages to ecasound I think you could use alsa's virmidi
driver. There is a quick toot covering using a sequencer to control a
softsynth this way which might be applicable:

http://linux-sound.org/quick-toots/4-sequencers_and_softsynths/quick-toot-midisynth_howto.html


then as far as a piece of software to do the actual controlling ...
there's something called vkeyboard ... perhaps one of the sequencers apps
like muse or rosegarden could be used? QMidiControl, xphat and others
listed here: http://sound.condorow.net/midi.html, might be interesting.
Though some of those links are broken ...


So, the pieces are all there, I think. But, as I said, I haven't tried
to put them together, yet. It looks like it is possible. But, anyway, I
hope this helps.

-Eric Rz.

I think there is a real need for a web site devoted to (links to?) music

In a related thought, I've wondered for a while where all of the Linux
servers supporting most of the individually developed web pages, not the
SourceForge stuff are. Are people paying for server space for these sites?
My cable modem ISP won't let me run a web server out of my house.

I ask in the spirit that if I was willing to run a site like your
suggesting, how do I do it on the cheap? The problem with streaming mp3s is
using up lots of bandwidth pretty quickly and getting turned off on the
$7.95/month type servers.

Hi all,
I have finally managed to get audacity installed, as well as stompboxes2.

I can put any sample I have into audacity and apply effects and edit it.
However, they have to be prerecorded samples.
I am trying to play my guitar through either audacity or stompboxes2.
All I can get out of stompboxes2 is s lot of hissing, I have tried muting the mic, unmuting it, etc. whith the mike unmuted I can hear a dry guitar signal.
I need to find a way to play my guitar through the app.
any ideas?

Thanks for the pointer. I suppose for your purposes you just use the free
service, or do you pay for one of the higher level services?

Also, I sort of thought these systems only worked for Windows servers. Does
their software strategy work with Linux and I suppose Apache also?

Thanks,

All I really need is a consistant web address that I can give out to people 
for private no-hassle/works-with-anything file sharing.  For this, the free 
service works perfectly.  The only downside is a slightly longer domain name 
(something.servehttp.com, for instance).  There are times, of course, when 
I'm tempted by the thought of switching my solobanjo.com domain over to 
No-IP, and hosting it myself, but there wouldn't be any real benefit to this 
right now - aside from the obvious power trip ;)


You can download an open source "dynamic update client" for Linux directly

ok, I'm Polish so I'll refrain from commenting... just in case :)


And neither of them will.  Chopin and Lutoslawski are dead.  I don't
think Penderecki cares.  Even less since he picked up conducting... 
There is also Gorecki, who reached stardom in the 90's with his
minimalist Symphony no.3 (composed some 10 years prior).  But I think
he's confined to instrumental writing and copying scores by hand.

However, there are some interesting things happening in the Polish
"underground".  I don't follow it too much but could dig up some links
if anyone's interested.

Otherwise, 99% of Poles dance (those who can, anyways) to Disco Polo
which definitely isn't a sign of classy and refined tastes.  I'm not so
proud of that side of things...

So, as pointed out above, from the Penderecki and friends perspective
it's pale (nice choice of words, btw :) ), from the disco polo
perspective it's probably too artsy.  Go figure.


How about a LAU remix project?
Could be fun.

I built jack and ssm (and rebuilt my 2.4.22 kernel with caps, lowlat, 
preempt) and I'm having problems getting the plugin to work.

First, there was a function pointer type mismatch in the sample
rate change callback function, which I fixed. Now, recent cvs
ssm builds with jack-0.80.0 (well, for me... I could send my
patch...)

I get the jack plugin gui rect on the canvas of ssm without
problem, it does switch back and forth between detailed and
simple GUI.

When I have the jack plugin without connecting it to anything
and not attached to the jack server, output to the oss output
works fine, but when I tell the jack plugin to attach, I get
a buzz sound whose pitch is the same as the rate the Process
callback is being called; if I have a mixer before the output
plugin, the volume of the pitch is scaled by the volume sliders.

When I have any jack plugin input connected from any ssm plugin
output, -and- the plugin is attached to jackd -and- the jack
plugin's input is routed to an alsa output, I get a different-
sounding buzz that is also the same rate as the Process callback
invocations. This buzzing sound is -not- scaled by any volume 
sliders in ssm.

At the moment, I'm not sure what to do... but I'm looking into
the possibility that the samples as represented by jack are
not of the same data type (-and- don't get converted) as the
samples as represented by ssm.

Comments? Help? :)

Hi list,

for the past few months I've used Kon Coliva's kernel patches ho have all 
the requisites to run jackd & Co.

http://members.optusnet.com.au/ckolivas/kernel/

But last time I checked those patches they gave me a bunch of errors 
against 2.4.22, plus I notice such development seems to have slowed down 
a lot.

What patches do you use to make a preemptible/lowlatency/capabilities 
enabled kernel? Where do I find them? =)

thanks, bye

You may be having sample rate mismatching in the options dialog. It has 
to be the same as the sample rate you run jack at and also has to point 
ot the same device hw:1,0 etc... ATM this is not automatic.

I am using ssm here now with latest cvs and the jack plugin.So far 
everything is working to order.

My fix for the function pointer type mismatch:

Seems that changing the declaration to an unsigned int on 
JackPlugin.C:174 and JackPlugin.h:62 is the fix.

Might there be a problem with input impedance though? A passive guitar 
pickup isn't exactly the same kind of output as eg a CD player, is 
it?

I'd been told that DI into my mixer was no good for bass guitar, so I 
rigged up an amp, speaker and large diagphram condenser mic instead. 
Result - exactly the same sound, only more noise.

Then I figured out it was my playing that made the bass sound so 
lame...

well, no. Some guitars have built-in battery powered preamps.
Many (most?) do not. These sometimes have a lot of output signal
(maybe approaching line level) but the impedance is all wrong.
You generally do not want to plug an electric guitar into
any device that expects a low-impedance line-level signal;
the result is very dull and weak.

otoh, you should hear SOMETHING :-)

This seems to be a bit of mis-information.  Bass, more than any other
instrument, works well with DI.  Dependin on the mixer, and the preamps
in it, you may not have any problems at all with this approach, or you
may need some sort of preamp/DI box between the bass and the mixer.

The signal from a guitar or bass is not at line level; it's equivalent
to a microphone level input.  Note that some mixers have 1/4" and XLR 
connectors for their inputs, and in some cases the use of the 1/4" input
bypasses the preamp circuit with the assumption that the input device 
is already at line level.  If you have a 1/4" plug to XLR cable, you
might find that makes a big difference in the strenth and tone of the
signal.

jack_nframes_t or something should be the correct type..

A bass can be connected with mismatched impedances and still sound good 
because the high freq loss due to mismatched impedances isn't clearly 
distinguishable. The same is not true for a guitar since loss in high 
frequencies is almost *always* very noticeable.

What I think is that James wants to connect his guitar and do live 
processing with stompboxes2. Have you tried with jackrack, gAlan or 
ecamegapedal? Just keep in mind that live processing isn't real time, it 
can approach it but, depending your soundcard and setup, can be truly 
disappointing.




-->><<--__-->><<--

it's not. you are correct.


i've been playing and recording bass for many years now so i can't
resist chiming in here...

it depends what you mean. normally "DI into mixer" means
bass -> DI box -> mic preamp on mixer, and this is a very common
way to record bass.

if you mean bass -> mic preamp, that's not usually good.
same for bass -> line-level input, unless the bass is active.
My old Ibanez with active Alembic electronics works fine connected
directly to any line-level input.


i highly doubt it was otherwise identical, but yes, it should 
be noisier :-)
FWIW i prefer large dynamic mics (akg d112, EV RE-20, maybe MD-421)
for micing a bass amp. Large-diaphragm condensers have a treble boost
that I find unflattering on bass guitar. I only tried a small-diaphragm
condenser once and it couldn't handle the low end.
I also prefer micing the bass amp to going DI. The 
speaker -> air -> microphone combination changes the 
frequency response and the attack in ways that I find very nice. 
Mic placement is critical. Mic pointed at the middle of the speaker 
cone is "standard" but not necessarily best for a particular sound.


oh, that :-)

Checking my mixer manual, I see the Tape input is designed for -10dBV 
but the Line input can do anything from -23dBV to +17dBV. It does say 
this line input is suitable for both instruments and high output 
mics, and it has a little picture of a guitar. So I guess that 
explains why the bass sound was OK in this case. 

As the old saying goes, 'read the full manual'. I think that's what 
RTFM stands for, anyway... 

Cheers

-->><<--__-->><<--

It is neither. Guitar pickups are roughly 10 kilohm impedance, 
while microphones are roughly 500 ohm impedance.
Both microphones and guitars are sensitive to the load you connect
them to. Mic preamp input impedance ranges from about 500 ohms
to about 5 kilohms.  Guitar preamps and DI's have input impedance 
ranging from 500 kilohms up to several megohms. 

So - don't do the following:

 passive guitar -> line-level input
 ... decent loading, low signal level, high noise

 passive guitar -> mic preamp
 ... good gain, really bad loading; frequency response
 suffers.

 active guitar -> mic preamp
 ... too much gain! probably distorted. not sure about the loading.


The following are reasonable solutions:

 passive guitar -> DI box -> mic preamp
 ... good loading, good signal level

 active guitar ->  line-level input
 ... good loading, good signal level

 active guitar -> DI box -> mic preamp
 ... good loading, good signal level, a bit noisier

    Hi guys, I don't konw if you can help me out here, but I could not 
find anywhere to ask this, so here I go.

    I recently downloaded an compiled OpenAL on my system via CVS. Every 
thing was OK, except when I tried to compile with support for my 
SB-Live! card (emu10k1 chipset, running through ALSA). I went trhough 
the instructions and the package did configure correctly, here's what I 
asked of it:

./configure --help (just to see what options did I have)
./configure --enable-arch-asm=yes --enable-alsa=yes --enable-sdl=yes 
--enable-emu10k1=yes --enable-vorbis=yes --enable-smpeg=yes\ 
--enable-capture=yes

Hi Everybody,

This mail is a direct consequence of the song Austin Acton posted recently. :) 
A nice little tune made with linux, about linux, that has been quite 
successful with very little advertisement. 

After a few brain rotations (before you ask, yes, I think by rotating my 
brain) I came to the conclusion that RIGHT NOW is a wonderful time to start a 
write_the_best_linux_song_contest!

My reasoning is that linux-2.6 is just around the corner, people are hungry 
for any kind of linux related information, no matter how far fetched (I don't 
even think this is very far fetched). Making a little contest to choose THE 
linux-2.6-theme-song seems like a very good way to attract some easy 
publicity, the main thing we want to do is make people interested in (and 
aware of) audio production under linux.
I'm confident that Slashdot (or any news site in the free software world for 
that matter) would gladly do a story on this event. BUT before we get to 
that, let's atleast produce some music ! :)


Some criteria I thought would be applicable:
- The song must be about linux in some way 
  (about linux 2.6 seems the obvious choice).
- The song must be (atleast) processed with a computer and 
  that computer must run linux.
- No computer running an operating system that is nonfree 
  can be used in the production. (External synthesizers or 
  similar stuff with advanced capabilties don't count as 
  computers and can thus be used)
- The song must be written by the artist 
  (possibly used with permission).
- The song would preferably contain some kind of voice track 
  ( it might be hard to hear that it's about linux otherwise, 
  and it would be nice to know how you people sound :-)
- the better the audio quality the better, though 
  I think there are other qualities of the recordings that count.
- Some info about the applications/gear used should be included
  (atleast applications).
- No prices, just free publicity for anybody that joins, 
  and most publicity for those that reach the top in the 
  event that we actually pull of a vote.
	
We already got one song, Austins! I'm in the middle of producing a naive 
electronic piece myself (I mainly play the guitar) that I think will be 
applicable also. But... two songs don't make a contest... So, what do you 
say? Are we up to it?

I'm calling all linux-artist wannabees, this is the time! I dare all 
developers that aren't on a deadline to take some time of from coding and 
also participate, bring out the artist in you! :)

Wouldn't you just die to hear "The ballad of Alan Cox", or "Linus' Theme" or 
"The Bitkeeper Blues" :) (those are free btw if anyone gets any bright 
ideas ;)

something creative, yes?

Let me know if there is any interest for this then I will try to formalize 
things a bit, website etc.
Well don't just sit there, let's do it! :) 

/Robert

Hallo,


I do pay for my webspace, but only a little bit and I only am allowed
about 5 gig transfer a month for that. Austin's wonderful song, if
downloaded 2500 times, has created about 6.250 gigs of traffic.
Imagine what amounts it would be if he would be seriously slashdotted. 

On the other hand modern filesharing like bittorrent or soulseek
intends and does take the load off a single person's webserver. I
think a community bittorrent tracker only for open source music would
be cool. archive.org seems to have something like that in its free
music department. 

Lastly scene.org is a major player in this area or free music (and
art). I think they are in part sponsored by public money plus
commercial sponsors.

Another example: The pure-data.org website was run privatly, but now
is in the hands of the austrian IEM institute. Linux music done with
Pd can be shared there, too, since shortly. See
http://pure-data.org/community/ (not much music available yet, though)

Hi all,
I have been able to record guitar parts in audacity. It weems to work real fine so far. However I still can't get anything to come through stompboxes2 other than a hissing sound. I guess it just wasn't meant to be.
What I intended to do with stompboxes2 was to just play through them at first, with the option of recording through them later. The way I usually record guitars is to tun them through an amp, and mike the amp, the mike going to a mixer, or more preferable the br-008.
I'm not too heartbroken over the stompboxes2 being broken because I still have the br-008, and I can always record through audacity ( pretty good ladspa effects there too!).
Thanks all who tried to help. 
This is one "Kick Butt" forum!

later,
james

Hi once again all,
I have installed rezound (succesfully I hope! ). But it seems to hang if I try to use jaskd.
Here's what happens:
I fire up an xterm and type:

jackd -d alsa -d hw:0

Then I see this:

jackd 0.80.0
---notices---
jack compiled with System V SHM support
loading driver ..
hw:0|hw:0|1024|2|4800|nomon|swmeter|rt
open
starting engine

Then I fire up another xterm and type: rezound

the second I do that in the first xterm (jackd's) I see this:
alsa_pcm:xrun of at least 8.834msecs

Then (or at the same time) a dialog box pops up on the screen:
Choose port for output Chose 1
I choose: alsa_pcm:playback.1
and I click on ok (green check mark)

Then everything stops

when I get tired of waiting and ^c the rezound window, this pops up in the jackd term:
subgraph starting at rezound timed out (subgraph_with_fd=11, status = 1086326156, state = Triggered)
subgraph starting at rezound timed out (subgraph_with_fd = 11, status = 1088326156, state = Triggered)

I am using the latest rezound :0.8.3beta
and jack is 0.80.0
alsa is version 9.rc2
sblive 5.1
850mHz stick of Celery
256mBram
lfs-4.0 distro

Hope this is enough info =)
 thanks again for al the help guys

Just to reply to myself,

I solved the problem:

I needed to install the snd-rtctimer for alsa. This required a patch to
the kernel RTC (patch included with ALSA but also needed a tweak. see:

http://www.geocrawler.com/archives/3/12349/2001/7/0/6299315/

)

After that, snd-rtctimer built okay. Then I added the following to
modules.conf:

options snd-timer snd_timer_limit=2
options snd-seq snd_seq_default_timer_resolution=2000 snd_seq_default_timer=1
options snd-rtctimer rtctimer_freq=2048
alias snd-timer-1 snd-rtctimer

Now, midi timing is sorted (at least for muse when running as root so it
can access the RTC.. seq24 doesn't seem to be quite there yet in my
experience).

                      ********JACK 0.90.0********

JACK is a low-latency audio server, written primarily for the GNU/Linux
operating system. It can connect a number of different applications to
an audio device, as well as allowing them to share audio between
themselves. Its clients can run in their own processes (ie. as normal
applications), or can they can run within the JACK server (ie. as a
"plugin").

JACK is different from other audio server efforts in that it has been
designed from the ground up to be suitable for professional audio work.
This means that it focuses on two key areas: synchronous execution of
all clients, and low latency operation.

Source packages for Jack 0.90.0 are available
http://sourceforge.net/projects/jackit/ .

                     ********Major Changes********
Buffers can resize during operation.  This can be triggered by the user
or by the function jack_set_buffer_size().  See the documentation for
details.  It is new code and still needs a shakedown.  It can be enabled
with './configure --enable-resize'.  If not compiled in,
jack_set_buffer_size() returns ENOSYS.  Applications should be prepared
for it though.

Major rewrite of the thread model.  This won't affect users.

Thanks to the rewrite, jack now has a "freewheeling" mode for faster
than realtime operation.  It decouples the engine from the soundcard.

The alsa driver has 3 new options.  --i, --inchannels sets the number of
channels to open for input.  --o, --outchannels sets the number of
channels to open for output.  -S, --shorts changes the order of in which
the sampleformats are tried.  The driver will try to use 16bit samples
first and only tries 32bit if this fails.  Useful if you digitaloutput
card supports 32bit samples but your interface doesn't.

                     ********Minor Changes********

Greatly increased support for other architectures.

--version also prints out the temporary directory.

Example clients expanded to be more helpful.

Many bug fixes.

Updated and improved documentation.

Portaudio driver works on linux.

jack_connect() returns EEXIST if a connection is already made.

Addition of jack_get_current_transport_frame ().

hw:0 is the default ALSA device instead of "default".

Jack's build system has better optimization.

--silent option for halting jackd's output.

Removal of --tmpdir and --asio options.

Will compile with alsa-lib-1.0.0pre1 (the latest).

                         ********Other********

Jack now has a mantis bugtracker at http://jackit.sf.net/mantis/ . 
Please use that for bug reports.

James has written a tutorial for jack programmers available at
http://dis-dot-dat.net/jacktuts/starting/index.html .

                       ********Deprecated********
These are deprecated structures and functions that have been
deprecated.  They will likely be removed in a future release.

The jack_transport_info_t struct has been deprecated.  Please use
jack_position_t instead.

jack_engine_takeover_timebase() has been deprecated.  Please use
jack_set_timebase_callback() instead.

jack_set_server_dir() has been deprecated.

jack_get_transport_info() has been deprecated.  Please use
jack_transport_query() instead.

jack_set_transport_info() has been deprecated.  Instead, define a
JackTimebaseCallback.

hi all - I'm trying to understand the concept of Jack Transport, so I can
understand what's not working, and what I'm just missing...

here's an example I crossing my fingers on, but figured wouldn't work:  run
jack, run ardour, run rosegarden.  set ardour to "jack transport master" and
rosegarden to "jack transport slave" - play ardour, hope that rosegarden
starts up - of course this didn't happen, but I can hope! :)

I knew it wouldn't happen, because the sync capabilities in both programs
aren't done, I know that part - but I was curious if it would try at least,
or what

but then it occurred to me that even with everything working, there may be
something more to do, perhaps with Jack  (what?  I dunno maybe
jackd --enablethedamntransport or something :) ) - so I thought I'd try and
find this out - and as always, I look around a bit, and if I don't start
finding mention of it pretty quick, I ask this list...

hi - this is really a question for the Ardour list, but for reasons beyond
my control, I can't get on the list (my ISP's fault) - so any of your Ardour
people - is it expected that Ardour would only allow 32 channels of output?

to explain, I found this out while mixing a project where I had 24 tracks in
ardour, all of which went to a different one of my 24 channels of output on
my HDSP 9652 card - everything great.  then I started adding a few tracks,
to be submixed - for example, channel 17 was vocals, and I had two more
vocal tracks in ardour, also routed to 17 for a nice little submix.  workin'
great.  but upon adding the 33rd track, it wouldn't allow me to assign it to
any output (I wish I could remember the log message it gives me).  since it
was exactly 32 I thought maybe it was an actual on purpose (or at least
temporarily on purpose) capability limitation and thought nothing of it

it only just now occurred to me to ask if it's not on purpose, but a bug or
a problem I'm having (in which case I would want to fix, or report, if it
were a bug)...

thanks!

Hi Aaron,

I'm not certain but seem to recall reading about the
32 track limit recently on ardour-dev-4b8TPpkIZ3Q@public.gmane.org I think Paul
D. said he intended to fix this trivial limitation.

I would suggest checking the Ardour site for a link to
the bug report database. If this hasn't been reported,
file a bug report.

BTW, you could get an email account from some web
service and use that to subscribe to ardour mailing
lists. It's fairly lame but is what I've done. Of
course I'm a shameless. :)

Hi,

I believe jack_transport, JOQ's new implementation, is
a standard part of jackd--doesn't require compile time
flags. Jackd does not require runtime flags to detect
clients that include jack_transport capabilities. 

Consequently, if either Ardour or Rosegarden included
the transport functionality, issuing transport
commands from either will cause the other to respond
in sync. Very user friendly.

The old jack transport sync capability is still
working, I think, but deprecated. Ardour supports the
old sync and JAMin supports the new implementation. So
I suspect you could sync Ardour and JAMin. Might be
worth trying just to see it.

Hello again,
 
 Just wanted to let everyone know, that I found a way to solve the problem - I
uninstalled rezound!. Seems such a shame as it was a nice lookin app, but I already have one app that doen't play nice with jackd, don't need two do I =).
 Oh, and I was having a problem with fftw. seems a person needs the old version (2.1.?) AND the new version (3.0.1), found this out by trial and error as googleand the archives weren't of any help.
So the batting average is thus:
9 audio applications installed or attempted. None work fully, 3 work soso.
 Funny thing is, in windows, I can take the apps that have been ported over to windows by those very same *nix developers and they work. So I'm wondering why they "finish" the job whenever they port to windows? Could it be that they know the windows people expect a certain standard? Maybe developers get lazy when designing for Linux? I don't know.
 The sadest thing is that I hate M$ and don't really care to use its OS, yet it looks like I'm still going to have to for some apps :(
 Lest you think it is my "unfamiliarity" with Linux. This is a lfs-4.0 system that I have made myself, it is connected to the net and 99% of it works just fine.

well, gtg, seems I've got to reinstall win2k on that box I took it off of :X

later,
james
hehe, these apps still don't make any noise :D

Greetings Linux Audio Users.

This posting is to announce and describe a project that I have
undertaken over the past two years with the grand hope that somebody
may care.   My goal is to gauge outside interest to determine whether
or not to spend time packaging the source code for distribution, which
I have not even started yet.  It would be some time before a release
package was available, for which I apologize.

To provide a very brief description of the project: It could be
described as CSound without the CSound environment; things are done
via ordinary scripts and at the command line.  It's also like the
GLAME Filternetwork, but without pictures or a GUI.  A lame version of
GLAME?  Perhaps it most closely resembles ecasound, except that it's a
set of programs for audio in the same manner that awk, grep, tr,
paste, and sed are for text files.   Ah, but there is more....

BACKGROUND

rooms such as concert halls...

     I, for one, am very interested in this concept.  I'd toyed with the idea 
of trying to do something along similar lines, but never went anywhere with 
it.

     The description you provide at the URL from your e-mail sounds very 
interesting, and I was disappointed that you didn't have some clearer 
demonstrations and/or examples.  If storage space or network bandwidth is an 
issue, I'd suggest that fewer examples at higher-quality levels would be 
preferable to more examples encoded with compromised quality.  Perhaps you 
could consider fading the two longer examples out halfway through, and 
encoding them at twice their current bitrate?

     I'm particularly interested in your 3-d room simulations, and I would 
love to hear both wet and dry versions of the drum loops.  The drum sound on 
the far left in "Strange Drums" amazed me.  I'd also be interested in 
listening to a string of impulse responses generated by several different 
settings.

     In summary, my vote is: Yes - please release your code as soon as you 
feel comfortable doing so, and please provide some better examples so I can 
get even more excited than I am now ;)

Hi all.

I had a sudden doubt about my left and my right.

I was firing up jack (through qjackctl, lazy i am) and then 
'alsaplayer -o jack somefiles*', getting the output playing 
fine. 
But then when i tried to mute a channel with the balance 
in alsaplayer, the unmuted channel was sent to both speakers. 
Even when disconnecting the left cable, the right channel was 
still outputed on both left and right ?!

I found the trick while writing this email, so i thought i should 
let you know. The culprit was the 3D Control switch of my emu10k1, 
which was set to on. Note for later, i won't use these one and a 
half D things again :)

Faster than realtime? Does this require loading the einstein kernel 
module?

Seriously, folks, I can appreciate that what is probably meant is 
'faster than what the hardware considers to be realtime', but I think 
we have to be careful with the semantics here. Otherwise, people will 
think that Linux audio developers are promising the impossible! 

Imagine: 'I overdubbed the guitar track and the second instrument came 
in half a second before the first, while on Windows it comes in half 
a second later. Linux rocks - and bends space-time too!'

With SuSE 8.2 it's a bit tricky, as the version of JACK included is 
old enough that some recent applications won't even compile with it 
(as it doesn't include the new transport API etc).  But if you 
install a newer JACK for the purposes of building newer apps, you'll 
get into trouble with any JACK-based apps already installed that were 
built against the old one, because they aren't compatible at the 
protocol level.

I would probably recommend uninstalling the SuSE JACK package and 
everything that depends on it, and going for the 0.90 release 
instead.  In my experience the packaged audio apps often don't work 
as well as any you might build yourself anyway (e.g. the Rosegarden-4 
package doesn't work for me as supplied in either SuSE 8.2 or 9.0 -- 
on 8.2 you unfortunately need to do "CXXFLAGS=-O0 ./configure" to 
build Rosegarden without optimisation to work around a compiler bug).


Don't know, but I do find the stock SuSE kernel gives better audio 
performance than the stock RedHat one.  So it's possible they have 
some of the patches.

Sure, but there's another meaning of realtime in the context of low or 
zero latency. I was thinking about hardware buffers and the 
impossibility of absolute realtime, more so faster than realtime 
operation. If you can have more than impossible.

Perhaps when making a joke in future, I should put JOKE: in the 
subject line!

Every distro seems to have their quirks, but I found that latency is not
the huge problem with suse that it is with a basic redhat install, but I
found that few of their distro audio apps work right, maybe Geentoo or
Mandrake are better, though I've also heard that debian is good, but a
lot of work. Anyways I wound up recompiling alsa, jack, and terminatorX,
so if I recompile rosegarden and muse, and get ardour working I should
be doing fine, I just need to recompile everything from cvs to  get the
best possible experience.

soulsource-w+B0EJWtgw4@public.gmane.org  I am doing my best to try to convince more music tech
magazines to publish articles about Linux as a viable music OS -- so if you
liked the article, please try to e-mail a note to the magazine saying so...

Thanks everyone!

These updates makes it possible to use windows vst plugins in
linux applications getting very descent realtime performance.

I have successfully ran vst plugins in ardour with 2.66 ms latency.

Sources:

Linux Vst Compatibility Page
http://80.61.20.184/vst/

Tutorial:
http://www.djcj.org/LAU/quicktoots/toots/vst-plugins/

Mandrake binaries: (not the latest versions (yet))
http://rpm.nyvalls.se/sound9.1.html



Vstserver 0.2.7 -> 0.2.8:
-------------------------
-Added SCHED_FIFO priority and locking all mem (mlockall) to the
 processing thread. Can be used without being root by for example
 using the givertcap program by Tommi Ilmonen
 http://www.tml.hut.fi/~tilmonen/givertcap/
 To turn off realtime priority, start the vstserver with either
 the "-NRT" or "--nonrealtime" flag.


vst ladspa plugin v0.1.5 - stable
----------------------------------
-Fixed the worst nonrealtimeness for the default mode.
 When using realtime priority on the vstserver, it
 should not be necesarry to set LADSPAVST_RT to "1".

Yes - I saw that in my newsagent. It's a pretty in-depth article 
covering several pages. Well done for getting it into a mainstream 
non-Linux magazine.

I did wonder who had written that piece, because for some reason there 
was no byline on it that I could see. I think that's a very unfair 
editorial policy (if that's what it is), especially for freelance 
writers who need credit where credit is due.

Hello all,

My article on building silent computers for studio use is now 
available without subscription from the SoS website. The C3 machine 
built for the article runs Linux, of course.

1. A short summary of changes

Ecasound's emacs mode, ecasound.el, has been updated to 
version 0.8.3. Due to severe bugs found in the native Python 
ECI implementation, the C implementation has been again set as 
the default. Minor interoperability problems with older JACK
releases and Ecasound have been fixed. A bug that caused builds
against an external libreadline to fail, has been fixed.
Also recording problems with the WinTv 401Dbx and other 
bt878-based devices have been fixed. This release is compatible
with the upcoming alsa-lib-1.0 releases.

---
2. What is Ecasound?

Ecasound is a software package designed for multitrack audio
processing. It can be used for simple tasks like audio playback, 
recording and format conversions, as well as for multitrack effect 
processing, mixing, recording and signal recycling. Ecasound supports 
a wide range of audio inputs, outputs and effect algorithms. 
Effects and audio objects can be combined in various ways, and their
parameters can be controlled by operator objects like oscillators 
and MIDI-CCs. A versatile console mode user-interface is included 
in the package.

Ecasound is licensed under the GPL. The Ecasound Control Interface 
(ECI) is licensed under the LGPL.

I've followed this thread lightly, I should've followed it closer

I've a question for you - what version of hydrogen are you using, and how do
you get it to sync to ardour?  this is something I haven't had any luck
with, and haven't even had a chance to spend enough time on, given how
important it is to my setup...

I'm using 0.8.1beta4 from CVS. I don't think earlier releases
had the jack transport support, not sure.


in the hydrogen preferences, audio driver,
select "jack", and check "jack transport slave".
Then click the play button and note that it isn't playing.

In Ardour, record-enable some tracks, click record,
click play, and note that hydrogen starts playing instantly.
Fun :-)

Well, apart from the fact that laptops have relatively poor ergonomics 
and are difficult to repair and upgrade, they are an expensive 
solution if you don't need portability. Also, most of my audio 
hardware requires a PCI slot.

But the main reason was that I set out to build a completely silent 
machine, and because of the tightly packed electronics in a laptop a 
fan is typically required. These are usually very small fans 
producing a high pitched whine when the CPU is under load, which is 
exactly the kind of noise I was trying to avoid.

These days a few (at least the ones with centrinos) don't need fans to 
run at >1.8GHZ.

I think the price/performance ratio is the biggest drawcard for using a 
PC.

I am currently working on a 'no-compilation, no-installation,
no-programming' user manual for Alsa-Jack-Ladspa.

I wanted to bring some friends of mine to Linux. They use Windows based
music software, so i intended to do some introduction (in spanish) to the
capababilities of Alsa-Jack-Ladspa(-Ladcca?) arquitecture for final users.
Due to the initial intent I did it in Spanish. Now it seems language was a
wrong choice. Most related documentation is full of programming and
installation details and I think that it is a globally needed
documentation. So i plan to do it more general and translate it but only
after the structure would get some degree of stability.

The current (Spanish) draft is located at:
http://www.salleurl.edu/~is04069/Modders/Docs/alsadoc.html

Most mature sections are 'General arquitecture', 'Sequencer' and 'Config
files syntax'. Maybe, some alsa hacker who undestand Spanish (Jordi?
Nando?) could review them. I have lot's of questions, since i had to
figure out a lot of things from code or from proposals (which i don't know
if they finally get implemented as explained). But I will ask those
questions only to the developers lists. That's the correct audience by
now, isn't it?

I would really like to do hardware mixing since my card should support 
it. I have been hacking away trying to google and decypher the plugin 
docs and have created the following asoundrc. However, when I try to run 
a second instance of fluidsynth on 44_2 I get the following error:
ALSA lib pcm_dshare.c:800:(snd_pcm_dshare_open) destination channel 
specified in bindings is alread used. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. 
Is alsa simply not capable of taking advantage of the ice1712 hardware 
mixer? Here is the asoundrc I have so far.

Greetings!

It's my pleasure to announce immediate availability of RTMix version
0.75.

RTMix is an interactive multimedia art performance, composition, and
coaching interface capable of triggering various DSP applications and/or
processes concurrently, as well as offering a tight coordination between
computer(s) and live performers. It can also trigger real-time events
utilizing MIDI and OSC protocols, and can be in theory networked from a
single client with up to 1000 other RTMix clients (personally neither
have I had the opportunity to try this and besides the network latency
would probably get the best of it anyways).

For more info on what it is, what it does, and how it does it, please
see the online docs:

http://meowing.ccm.uc.edu/~ico/RTMix-doc/

Changelog:

*Minor bug fixes in scripting language.
*Ability to connect directly to /dev/sequencer (needs to be tested --
any 	help in bug reporting is greatly appreciated!). This should
theoretically enable users to have theoretically infinite number of
MIDI devices hooked up to RTMix (using ALSA's aconnect).
*UI improvements (mostly "eye-candy").
*New LED icons for improved visibility.
*Improved functionality of the Console.
*Full documentation included in the distribution (just in case someone
missed this one from before :-).
*New application icons (16x16 to 192x192).
*Smaller tarball.
*This is the last version before the milestone 0.8 release with that
will 	sport a completely revamped UI and many new features.

RTMix has so far been featured at ICMC 2002 conference (Sweden), SEAMUS
2003 conference (US), in the "Organised Sound" magazine (December 2002),
and has been used in several of my works whose recordings are available
on my website. If you happened to use RTMix in your work, I would love
to hear in what ways you got to utilize its features, as well as how can
I make the application better. Thanks!

The tarball is available for immediate download from:

http://meowing.ccm.uc.edu/~ico/rtmix-latest.tar.gz (4.07MB)

For more info, please visit my website and/or the online documentation
(provided above).

Best wishes,

Ivica Ico Bukvic, composer & multimedia sculptor
http://meowing.ccm.uc.edu/~ico





-->><<--__-->><<--
Why should this happen? Looking at Ico's new RTMix, I follow the links
here

http://meowing.ccm.uc.edu/~ico/RTMix-doc/5.html

to listen to some samples. 

The first sample takes me to a page 

http://www.ohiolink.edu/etd/view.cgi?ucin984494016

with an mp3 link in the upper right. I click on that link and I'm forced
to download the mp3.

However, the second sample loads the mp3 in Mozilla using gxine and
plays in the browser.

Why should this happen? Why shouldn't they both play in Mozilla?

Thanks,
Mark

P.S. - I like the music Ico




-->><<--__-->><<--


I think this is depends on the respective servers. Seems that the first 
webserver isn't configured to put the correct MIME-type for MP3 into the
HTTP header, thus leading Mozilla to handle it as random data.

cheers,
Christian



-->><<--__-->><<--

The server where this one below is hosted is sending out the wrong
mime.type in the returned headers. Should be audio/mpeg or audio/x-mpeg.

curl -I http://www.ohiolink.edu/etd/multiview.cgi/ucin984494016/Final.mp3
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 21 Nov 2003 05:26:23 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.26 (Unix) PHP/4.2.3
Content-Type: application/octet-stream

With such a large (25Mb) files they should have "m3u streaming" links
as well, which I know xmms respects... but then if that server is not
configured for mp3 then there is no hope for m3u.

--markc




-->><<--__-->><<--

Doesn't that mean you'll have two sound servers running at once? 
Wouldn't it be better from an architectural point of view to make KDE 
sound applications JACK clients? I realise that KDE developers may 
have an emotional attachment to artsd, but in my experience I've 
always had to disable it to do any audio work.

Anyone want to defend the use of artsd?

Daniel



-->><<--__-->><<--

Are you running envy24control? That gives you a lot of control over 
levels and routing for cards based on that chipset.

Cheers

Daniel



-->><<--__-->><<--
I am not necessarily interested in defending Artsd since I myself also
do not care much for it. What I can do is though explain that artsd
supposedly does a lot of other things that the KDE ppl seem interested
in. In other words, chances for us convincing them to switch strictly to
Jack are nil (tried before, as I'm sure some of you did as well, and
pretty much got nowhere). This way at least we get to have JACK as the
backbone of all servers and have KDE still with its architectural
solution intact.

I think it's great news, considering the alternatives.

Ivica Ico Bukvic, composer & multimedia sculptor
http://meowing.ccm.uc.edu/~ico





-->><<--__-->><<--

I'll take a swing.  It's a working way to get multiple stream output
for applications.  Yes, we would scoff at its performance but that's not
important.  I don't really care if xmms and gaim have some amount of
latency in their playback.  All I care is that the sound comes out
within a reasonable amount of time.

So this would let there be two classes of audio apps - important ones,
and unimportant ones ::-).  Important apps like ardour can use JACK directly
and have synchronized operation and low-latency.  Unimportant apps like
gaim can just go "bong" at some point when they need to.

i tend to say: "me not." but it ahhmmm... depends,

1.) would jack be "scalable" enough to run xmms and kolf with sound
enabled at the same time on a Pentium1/166MHz as arts does with arts for
my 9 year old Daughter ?

2.)would jack be as stable and powerfull than as it is when optimized
for pro-Apps only ?




-->><<--__-->><<--

Agreed, I think this is the best thing - existing "bings and beeps" type
apps are unlikly to switch to a JACK style API for the audio i/o, and if
they did they wouldn't be particiaularly happy - JACK does no sample rate
conversion, bit depth changes or any of that stuff (and never will if I
have anything to do with it).

So, the apps dont have to change thier api, but are still compatible with
JACK - thats great. Hopefull it also means that when a consumer audio app
underrruns it wont affect JACK, and the arts server wont block.

Heh, yeah, exactly - I should have read your reply before replying to
Ico, sorry :)

-->><<--__-->><<--

Depends how much ram you have - jack requires quite a lot. The cpu load is
pretty low though, for largish buffer sizes.


No - adding things like sample format negotiation and sample rate
conversion would seriously hurt JACK.

Let's hope the JACK support in arts is built that way then - a bit of 
liaison required with the KDE folks, perhaps?

Maybe it's just me, but if I'm listening to or recording music I don't 
really want bings and beeps being sent to the soundcard by every 
program running on the desktop. I guess that's why I never missed 
artsd after I disabled it...

JACK developers have been trying for a long time to explain these
issues to the many people who want to use it for everything.  It works
great for ardour, so why not do "beeps" and "tadas" that way?  The
answer is that JACK achieves low latency by placing non-negotiable
realtime deadlines on its clients.  They must make a serious effort to
meet these requirements lest they get kicked out by jackd, the JACK
server daemon.  Consumer sound really needs an extra layer of
buffering, format conversion, and hand-holding between it and jackd.

Arts is one solution for that problem.  Having never used it I can't
speak about its strengths or weaknesses.  But, it is integrated into
the KDE desktop, which is valuable in its own right.

The current problems with artsd and jackd occur when a user tries to
start jackd but artsd is already running, so the audio device is busy.
Hopefully, the KDE developers will configure things so that this works
smoothly.  

I do wonder how they will do it, though.  Will they expect jackd to be
running all the time?  Most users don't run it that way today.
Perhaps by the time KDE 3.3 comes out jackd will have evolved a config
file so it can start automatically as needed.

Hallo,


Well, but what's the point of having a soundserver at all when ALSA
can do the mixing of the bings and beeps with its dmix plugin itself?
Even format and samplerate conversion could be done with ALSA. The
advantage is, that a soundserver would not block the soundcard all the
time and thus has to be disabled by users.

(Before I'm misread: There is a place for Jack, of course, which is
way more than a soundserver)

Or why we don't want to encourage apps that just need that functionality 
to use jack by default.

Good reaon to let them run via artsd. Then it's just a simple task of 
turning on artsd support when you want that functionality and turning it 
off when you dont. We could accomplish this by making jackd disable 
artds on startup ;)

Another flag for someone to implement :)

Well, KDE is suppoed to cover more than just linux, so they need a

available). Not even all linux distributions have alsa support yet.

Given that the two most popular 'KDE supporter' Linux distributions 
(SUSE and Mandrake) also install ALSA by default, maybe dmix rather 
than artsd support is what we should be lobbying the KDE developers 
for.

As pointed out already, artsd is no use with non-KDE applications, of 
which at least one is likely to be running on a KDE desktop at any 
one time.

   that's one fat lie (yes it does but no it doesn't solve the problem 
it's supposed to solve). if you need it in the first place (card does 
not support multi channels) you cannot use it because not all aps use it 
and you're in the same audo blocking hell as without it.

   example: set mozilla to use arts, set xmms to use arts etc... and 
then go and surf the web, flash, realplayer etc. all do not use arts and 
thus your mozilla blocks (looks frozen) on number of pages... (I suspect 
it's mostly flash, used in banners, not playing any sound but still 
trying to open audio)

   now what did arts help exactly?

   that's why the problem of multiple applications trying to use 
soundcard has to be solved by something that pretty much everybody uses

In theory, yes, but has anyone seen KDE running on Solaris or anything 
like that? All the non-Linux platforms running free software desktops 
that I've seen have had GNOME - BSDs users, for example. Sun even 
built SUSE with a GNOME interface for its (cough...) 'Java Desktop'. 

I guess artsd could be retained for legacy use, but with ALSA 1.0 just 
around the corner, what's any Linux distributions excuse for not 
making it the default? And we know that artsd won't be much use until 
the non-KDE applications support it, which isn't very likely.
 
Cheers

Daniel



-->><<--__-->><<--

I've seen far more FreeBSD desktops with KDE than with GNOME.

That's the reason Rosegarden-4 still has vestigial aRts support in it, 
even though it doesn't actually work properly at the moment -- 
because it's the only practical possibility of getting RG to work 
with sound anywhere other than on Linux.  And of course you can run 
aRts without running a KDE desktop; I've used it under wmx on BSD.

Sorry, couldn't help not to respond to this one. I understand that many
people out there are still trying to squeeze the very last bit of life
from their old hardware, but let's face it, if we want to see Linux on
the desktop as a dominating force any time soon, then we need to stop
worrying whether every single feature will run on our grandma's 486. We
all know that Linux is about choice, but more importantly it is about
understanding when it is appropriate to utilize particular features this
choice offers us. In other words:

If you want to run Artsd directly through the soundcard on your old
thunderbucket pc just to hear that "you got mail," you can. But let's
face it, you won't be using that computer for any serious DSP work.
Hence you have no need for Jack, nor do you need to worry whether it
will run on such a machine well (because it most likely won't and more
importantly it shouldn't have to).

OTOH, if you want a serious workstation that is still able to do silly
blips every time your desktop wants to warn you about something, then
with the artsd implementing Jack you'll be able to do that too.

Some people have mentioned that they have really not missed these blips
and beeps since they disabled the artsd. I happen to believe that such
sounds are integral part of our healthy desktop experience (think people
with disabilities, audible reminders from our calendars that make us be
on-time for our appointments even though we are in the middle of our
creative frenzy, or finally getting rid of that lousy and annoying
built-in speaker beep), and as such it is a big stepping stone in having
Linux desktop adopted by the mainstream customer base.

Some people do not care if Linux ever gets adopted by the mainstream
customer base. I tend to think that the adoption of Linux into the
mainstream desktop environment will elicit more interest from the
commercial audio companies and eventually bring us a winning combination
of the OSS and commercial audio apps. Call me a dreamer if you want, but
I think that we're very close to this.

Now, if we could only get Gnome to do the same with their Gstreamer
architecture, and make sure that Jack can run indefinitely without
crashing, we'll be set! (please correct my ignorance if this has already
been done)

FreeBSD on the desktop is quite a minority taste though, isn't it?


That's the rub...


I thought JACK had been ported to OS X, at least initially? If you're 
producing serious audio software, I would have thought OS X is the 
most compelling target platform after Linux.

Thanks for the info Christian. In IE6 they both play, but the 25MB one does

In Mozilla the 25MB one never plays. It just downloads and leaves you to

I was trying to stay out of this thread, but... GNOME is prevalent on
Solaris because 1) building something like GNOME or KDE on Solaris is
non-trivial and you want the vendor (Sun) to do it for you. I have no idea
why many vendors have chosen GNOME. At least here at work and among the
geeks I know outside, KDE usage (on linux or BSD, whatever) is much higher
than GNOME usage, by a wide margin. YMMV. artsd does have some uses (see
below) and you can disable it if you want.


Artsd works well for things like emulating full-duplex on crap-arse
onboard sound rigs like this 810 rig I'm sitting at. Sure. it doesn't rock
on the big iron hardware but for a general consumer sound rig it works
fine. I've been running arts on top of ALSA for 2 years now w/o a failure
or glitch. There's no reason for non-KDE apps to support artsd, as far as
I can see so long as they can get to the OSS-emulation layer or better yet
are ALSA native.

Also, as I understand it, ALSA is standard (in linux) starting with 2.6.0,
right?

This scenario does actually work if you use konqueror, even with plugins that

enable it) and can thus avoid the problem.
That said... it is still a kludge. A unified environment would have been much 
better, but the odds for achieving this aren't very good.

Linux has to take a rather big piece of the market before plugin makers (and 
similar) will make specific adaptions for the environments faced. Realplayer 
is the one, of the top of my head, that comes closest, they have support for 
both /dev/dsp and esd. Now, how much good does that do? ;).
I think this whole debacle has the potential of undermining the entire concept

::shrugs:: If you use non-free software, you get what you're fed.

If you use free software that doesn't support arts and just needs to go
"boing", adding an arts (or even esd) interface isn't *that* involved.
In fact both have /dev/dsp wrappers that may or may not work already (I
can't say I've ever used said wrappers).


That's why JACK is really the key software bit, not arts/esd - JACK
gives a metal interface that lets lower performance apps use a
virtualized interface.  JACK can mitigate the hardware, provide high
performance apps high performance, and send out a beep when something
wants it.

   double shrug! this is not the problem of the non free apps, this is a 
problem of _bad_ infrastructure (or perhaps unfinished - imagine a world 
without X, with only berlin, ggi, svgalib etc. - that's an analogy of 
current audio situation).


   free or non-free it should work and it doesn't. yes I could fix some 
of them or bug developers to fix it or pay somebody to fix or... but the 
  important part of free software is that it actually _works_, nobody 
has time to fix everything... (even for values of everything limited to 
the programs that one uses)


   there has to be something that everybody will/can use and will not 
create a weak impersonations of BSOD while running (like programs 
freezes when they try to access the soundcard, often it's not that easy 
to find out that it's waiting for the soundcard (for general users))

   perhaps dmix in alsa is that something...

	erik




-->><<--__-->><<--
Hallo,


Your certainly right here, I admit. But I don't think, that the
functionality of dmix belongs into a soundserver, let alone two. So
it's a very wise decision by Takashi, Jaroslav et al. to make this a
part of the soundsystem in general. Having a common sound API across
platforms is a different thing, but the KDE folks could just use
something like Portaudio instead here, which is availalble on many
more than Linux. If Artsd was just another kind of Portaudio, it would
be fine. (Although redundant)

I never used Artsd and have seldom used Esound, but with the advent of
dmix, they should go down in history as soon as possible, I think.
They did and still do disturb users.

The best I have got is 8 minutes of recording with the q4b virtual

which causes problems for JACKS realtime constraints.


No idea why. It may not even be neccessary anymore.

What we should be lobbying the KDE developers about - and also working 
towards from the audio end is ensuring compatibility between ALSA/Jack apps 
and KDE in general. 

I'm using Agnula/Demudi and it's taken a fair amount of juggling to be able 
to have both KDE and ALSA apps running in the same installation. This has 
more to do with libqt3 versions than ALSA. I assume this is due to many audio 
developers not using KDE at all (?yes that's an assumption). I can't remember 
where, but I know I've read many times the suggestion that we should disable 
arts in Kcontrol. I don't miss the whistles and bells at all - if I need an 
audible reminder I put cdplay in an "at" or "cron" job. Frankly I can't see 
myself doing any serious audio work using the KDE desktop - if I need a gui 
I'll use fluxbox, however it would be nice to easily switch between modes as 
has been suggested.

btw: I tried running Jack on a P133 and 
hahahahahaha you must be joking :-)

Hi all. I'm trying to get VST plugins run under linux (a RH9 with Planet
CCRMA, kernel 2.4.22-6.ll.rh90).

I've followed those steps:

- downloaded vstserver-0.2.8 (ladspavst too)

- i've installed wine simply untar it, then ./wineinstall 
- i've compiled vstserver and ladspavst following their instructions

- i've correctly set VST_PATH (if i do "cd $VST_PATH" it brings me to
correct folder)

Now, when I run vstserver, then open a sound application (Audacity, in
example), i'll get this error:

Hi all. I'm trying to get VST plugins run under linux (a RH9 with Planet
CCRMA, kernel 2.4.22-6.ll.rh90).

I've followed those steps:

- downloaded wine 20031118
- downloaded vstserver-0.2.8 (ladspavst too)

- i've installed wine simply untar it, then ./wineinstall 
- i've compiled vstserver and ladspavst following their instructions

- i've correctly set VST_PATH (if i do "cd $VST_PATH" it brings me to
correct folder)

Now, when I run vstserver, then open a sound application (Audacity, in
example), i'll get this error:

VSTSERVER/main: Vstserver 0.2.8 started. Waiting for requests.
VSTSERVER/main: Going to try to start vst plugin "DFX Transverb.dll".

Quite likely. I asked around with some friends on the internet and it
seems split pretty evenly. That and many people don't use either (I do
most of my recording using fluxbox). Too much coffee, not enough brain.


In ths spirit of this thread, is it really even possible that any sound
server could be used across window managers? Are people suggesting that
jackd be used as the lower-level sound daemon all the window managers
could talk to? I assume ALSA in 2.6 is going to look (from above) just
like the OSS sound layer. Doesn't this solve the problem? Or do
artsd/esd/whatever get "in the way"? Will a window manager have to be
re-coded if it assumes there's a lower-level daemon that emulates
full-duplex on cheap hardware? artds has saved my bacon on 2 workstations
at work with cheap-arse onboard sound. Would something like KDE require
significant re-coding to use jackd?

artsd seems to work fine for me, including sound in browsers. But I turn
off all the window manager sounds (when using KDE) so maybe I've just
never seen the conflict. I don't use it when I use jack/ardour though.

off-topic: are there any newsgroups like this one that deal with home
studio design and layout for the hobbyist?

To use jackd nativly? Yes, it would require some pretty major changes, but
thats one benefit of arts, it only has to be changed there.

I disagree. The resources of free software developers are finite, and 
yet the potential demand from users for diverse (and therefore 
difficult to support) configurations is great. The reason that Linux 
audio is becoming successful is that a number of developers have 
standardised their work around that kernel. Imagine if everyone on 
this list ran a different system, maybe Hurd or Darwin based - 
progress would be very hard.

The only free software system with a chance of breaking into the 
mainstream desktop market is a Linux based one, and that's by no 
means assured. So I see no point in supporting any other kernel for 
the time being.

Of course, some people don't care about the bigger picture, and are 
quite happy to use an operating system to their individual taste 
while 99% of the desktop market remains proprietary. The problem is 
that the dominance of the 99% can mean the free operating systems are 
prevented from running on the next generation of hardware somehow.

Hi,
   I apologize as I didn't read maybe the first 20 posts in this thread, but
I haven't seen any discussion of this in the last 15 I read this morning. If
this got covered really early on please excuse my going over old ground.

   Has anyone considered trying to write an arts device driver that instead
of talking to hardware talks to Jack? Why can't all of Alsa & Jack just look
like hardware to arts? Arts apps could then use arts, and then arts itself
got down to trying to send audio the arts 'driver' would just be talking to
Jack.

   I am presuming that the 'ta da' issue would be easily addressed by
something like this. It was reported some time ago that Wine has Jack
support doing something like this I presume.

   I don't see why you couldn't run many sound servers doing something like
this, but I'm sure there's some simple reason. (Or not...)

   Sorry for butting in so late...

   being locked in into linux is not much better than being locked in 
into ms windows.

   isn't the promise of unix design the ability to cooeperate, to work 
together, the portability etc.? and doesn't it work that way for pretty 
much everything?

   networking, graphics, apps - almost everything that you can run on 
linux runs on other unix/unix-like systems.


   yeah, just like tcp/ip, X windows etc. didn't get anywhere because 
they work on top of different kernels...


   breaking into desktop market is _consequence_ of good apps. and 
portability brings good apps (even though it might not be obvious)

   large picture: I really don't understand this obsession with linux, 
which quite often becomes exactly opposite of what linux is standing for 
(sort of, it stands for something else for different people). I mean 
what we (all users) need are computers that work (good functionality, 
flexible enough, easy to use, robust, interoperability etc.). and linux 
is bringing what unix was almost giving us - a unix(like) system that 
has no vendor lock-in features that were so annopying when using 
proprietary unix-es. So all the free unix/unix-like systems work very 
nicely together, pretty much all apps are fairly portable, even oss is 
portable (I haven't used it on non-linux systems personally), alsa is 
one of the few proprietary-like feature of linux... of course, somebody 
can port alsa since it's open source so it's not exactly the same... 
(yes, I know there are too few people working on alsa and that I can go 
ahead and port it to other kernels if I care so much etc.)

-->><<--__-->><<--
I just got demudi 1.0, installing regular debian woody 3.0, and then using
apt-get to grab alsa, jack, and the other demudi apps. I realized that
even though Suse's kernel is better than a stock debian or redhat kernel,
I found with apt-get its very easy to install the new low latency demudi
kernel, and unlike Suse I don't have to spend $80 every six months to keep
things current, everything I wanted from Suse is available with apt-get. I
did find a couple of errors with demudi, where sox has a little problem,
but most everything worked very easily, especially the hard stuff like
installing the new kernel. I can always build sox from source.

If you really feel that way, I guess you have some porting to 
do... better go get started ;)

  at work I use freeBSD and before that I used number of different unix

Hmm, well I am at work atm so  can't check. But I do know all my

I don't know about rear speakers. I currently have no sound as I only have a
digital audio cable going to an external dolby decoder - and I'm trying to
get SPDIF to work.. I do know that if SPDIF does work the rear speakers
aren't used unless you are watching a Dolby Digital movie - that is what the
5:1 thing is all about. There are currenty only a very few music CDs
recorded in Dolby digital - and even fewer in DTS.

I hope this helps.

   I would appreciate some advices as to what HW do I need to do some 
simple recording.

   Here's what I would like to be able to do:

   tasks: record a guitar, possibly other instruments (not neccessarily 
at the same time), record old vinyl from turntable etc. [using linux PC]

   in:

   few audio channels (I can think of using 2 or 4 so I guess I should 
plan for about 8?)

   midi

   out:

   just stereo audio? or optical digital something? does it make sense 
to have many outputs?

   midi

   other:

   full duplex, I think built in midi wavetable synth is good enough for 
me, not sure about external mix (I've read recommendation to have one 
but I'm not sure why).

   I've read that Delta* cards are fairly good and well supported under 
linux - looks like delta 66 is what I want? What about Delta 1010-LT - 
same price, more in/out but no external box (=lower sound quality?).

   What about midi? I'd like to have midi in/out and wavetable synth 
(not sure if I really need synth). The sync-ing midi and audio is done 
by apps so I don't have to worry about cards working well together?

   I can read the specs but I'd really appreciate practical advices 
since I have almost no experience (well, I have few audio cards:-).

   TIA

	erik




-->><<--__-->><<--
If you don't need digital I/O then the Delta 44 is just as good as the
Delta 66 at a somewhat lower price.  If you want 8 I/O channels then I
would spend the extra money on the 1010 (not the 1010LT), the DSP 2000
C-Port, or the EWS88MT.  The MIDI support for the DSP 2000 is apparently
not there yet (I don't do MIDI) so you probably don't want that.  I'm
not sure about the EWS88MT.  M-Audio seems to be the best choice at the
moment.

-->><<--__-->><<--
I recommend to have a close look upon DA/AD-Convertor-Quality, 2
channels at top notch quality are better then 8 with compromized sound,
especially, if you want to use your recordings later on for professional
studiowork.
I use a Hi-End 2-channel card (Terratec EWX 24/96) and i am very pleased
with that even though i had to pay only about 200,- EUROS for it.
Plus: the card is perfectly supported by alsa - means, it is better
supported as by the Factorydriver terratec is offering for Win32 :-)
Duplex is also very important and not an issue with 24/96.

The chain is as weak as its weakest segment:
take care for good Cables, preamps etc

Hi all!

I used to play MIDI with AWE-64 with 24 MB RAM extention.

So I could use the SF2 soundfonts.
Unfortunately, the AWE-64 requires an EISA slot.

Could please enybody recommend a PCI successor of the
AWE64 which allows loading of SF2 soundfonts.

Please do not recommend Audigy! This is a lie! The
Audigy ALSA driver accidentally  drops some
tones.  This is a known bug, but
apparently nobody is willing to fix this

See.

http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/doc-php/template.php?company=Creative+Labs&card=Soundblaster+Audigy+Platinum&chip=Audigy&module=emu10k1

Furthermore it ignores reverbation and
chorus instructions.

Please do not recommend FluidSynth. To avoid
misundersandings: Actually FluidSynth is a good
software. But it produces wrog envelopes for
strings and clarinets. The envelops are
like xylophone (or so ...)

I alreay mentioned this problem on this list.
But without success.

To summarize,

with the exemptions you did there are no alternatives left.

PCI based cards that support SF2 are basically all Creative cards, starting 
with the SB-Live.
Though, In linux I think they all use the same driver so unless it's fixed 
there's not much you can do.

To my knowledge there are two SF2 capable softsynts, Fluidsynth and Timidity. 
I don't use Timidity so I can't say anything about it.
As for Fluidsynth, it works very well for me, there are probably bugs, though 
it works. 
Unfortunately the mailinglist(and project) is pretty much in hybernation at 
the moment so I understand perfectly that your propositions have not been 
implemented.
If you have a good idea of what the problem is, it would be great if you tried 
and poked around in the Fluidsynth code yourself (probably not what you 
wanted to hear ;)

Regards,
Robert

Unless you can get the discontinued SB Live 512 - its a PCI card, and

I do still stand by my claim though, even if there is a new driver... what 
applies to the Audigy most certainly applies to the Live. (I even think I

Live has a chip called emu10k
Audigy has a chip called emu10k2 (or something similar)
They are in many respects the same, and that goes for the drivers also.

If SB-Live does not work sufficiently, why dont trying to use Terratecs
EWX24/96? The card does not have Hardware SF-Support but you can load
SFs into RAM (if you have enough...) and it works perfectly well for me.

AWE64 was a great card for its price back in the days, when ISA was the
default for Soundcards. That the support for these cards is fading is
only natural, since the great PCI-Cards, shipped nowadays are simply
much better and thus more interesting for developers also...

Conclusion: try Delta 66 or some similar Pro-Gear or try it with a
ICE-chipbased card like terratecs muse, whitch are verywell supported by
alsa and can play SF from RAM.

I'm not quite sure that these are about SF2. The first one uses Timidity,
the second one is library, which gives support of Gigasampler files and

I would use TiMidity++ But in contrast to FluidSynth this program
loads every instrument (program) immediately before it is
needed.

This leads to gaps if a new instrument begins to play.

FluidSynth (seems to) load(s) the whole soundfont into 
the ram AT program start.

  TiMidity can be configured to use soundfonts. Here's the contents of 
my ~/timidity.cfg file :

Erik,

I'm having good success with the Delta1010 LT.  I know the analog 
and SPDIF I/O works as does MIDI input.  I've not tested MIDI output
yet, but I suspect it works.  I've heard that not all of the LT
functions are supported by ALSA, but I have yet to find one that I
need.

For what you're wanting to do the Delta 44 or 66 would work, but if
you can spend the extra money for a 1010 it would allow you to do
more in the future.

As to your external mixer question, I don't have one, but the 1010LT
has 2 mic preamps.  If you go with the 44, 66, or 1010, or want
better quality pres, you'll need a mixer or external preamp.  An
external mixer is not a requirement in the DAW world, but it can be
helpful for monitoring and such.  Personally, I'd use the money for a
better soundcard or some nice pres.

You may be right about WildMidi, it uses Timiditys config
structure and guspats but may not do soundfonts like Timidity.
The libgig library definately handles SF2 as well as gigasample.
I guess I should have said Timidity and libgig... and WildMidi
probably will soon.

Specimen is a midi controlled sampler, and it's very first public
release is available from http://www.gazuga.net/specimen.tar.gz

In all honesty, I advise against downloading this in it's current
state unless you intend to hack on it or play with it for sheer
amusement value only.  There are a few TODO items that must be taken
care of before this can be considered usable software (as the next
release will be).  The main reason for this release is because I said
I was going to make a release in a couple of weeks 15 days ago.
It's very nascent stuff.

You have been warned.

Downloaded, compiled, ran (couldn't load wavs though).  Neat anyway. 
This makes three sampler projects starting to take shape for linux. 
There's a big niche to be filled in this area so I'm psyched.

Would you mind offering a hint as to what kind of features you intend to
implement?

Wha...?  You should be able to load wavs, I have several gigs of them
in various formats and I've been able to load them without a hitch.
My gui design is probably unintuitive, and it isn't evident that you
must first add a patch (action->add), then the 'Load Sample' button
will become usable.


The main goals are quality, efficiency, and flexiblity.  I want it to
sound good, I want it to be lean and fast, and I want to leave as much
up to the user as possible without being overly overwhelming.  In a
more practical, short term sense, I want to support cuts; sample
looping via several different methods; regular and granular pitch
scaling; several built in filters; envelopes for volume, panning,
filter cutoff, and resonance; a few built in distortions; and effects
via the LADSPA interface.

But first, I need to make sure the users can load wavs...

[pb]



-->><<--__-->><<--


I would use TiMidity++. The problem is: In contrast to FluidSynth
TiMidity loads the instruments not until they are really needed.

That is: If the clarinet keeps silent for - say - 20 measures
the clarinet waves are not loaded. In measure 20 TiMidity
starts loading the clarinet. This requires processor time
and leads to a short gap. (Also with my 2.4 GHz Intel)

Does anybody know how to change this behaviour?

And: Does anybody know how to recorord the FluidSynth
aoutput into a WAV file ?

Will a plain old SoundBlaster Live! Platinum do you for this? For SF2

it much for MIDI jobs, and only have sued a couple soundfonts on it with 
ALSA.

Hi there. It's been a while i'm wondering if this soundcard is linux 
usable, especially the SPDIF facilities (since it's why my wife is 
interested in this card.) The open source drivers projects around 
creative products didn't convince me of wether this card do function or 
not under our prefered OS. On this archive i found some hope but i would 
thank a lot to hear "Yes boy you jusrt can relax plug your minidisc in

Has anyone else seen dropping of notes with EMU10K1 ALSA drivers mentioned by Joerg during wavetable synthesis?

I have seen dropping of notes with both EMU10K1 and ICE1712 EXTERNAL MPU-401, but I don't believe this is because of the drivers.  Neither Muse nor Rosegarden function well on my machine, but pmidi has absolutely no problems.  I have been assuming that these dropped notes are due to the larger load of GUI MIDI sequencers versus command-line sequencers, not the drivers.  Rosegarden is worst, Muse next.  BTW, Rosegarden is much, much worse for me than any Windows sequencers I have.  I run 2.4.20 with the usual kernel patches for low-latency.

Just curious about what others have seen.  Thanks!





-->><<--__-->><<--

If you're using Rosegarden-4 0.9.1 or earlier, then be aware that the 
0.9.5 release -- which will probably come out tomorrow -- has a vastly 
improved sequencer-GUI comms layer over the nasty kludge that was in 
0.9.1, and hence sequences a lot more smoothly.  There are still some 
file prefetch issues to be worked out on the audio side, but MIDI is 
generally very solid (for me at least) these days.

If you're already using the CVS version and hence already have 
everything that'll be in 0.9.5, then... erm... say so, I guess.

the analogue input is of poor quality, as one might expect...

sometimes the WHOLE COMPUTER hangs.  with jack+ardour, there where no

have a look at 

http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/doc-php/template.php?company=Creative+Labs&card=Soundblaster+Audigy+Platinum&chip=Audigy&module=emu10k1



It has nothing to do with the sequencer. Please have
a look at:

There is an example which always causes droped notes.
Independent of which sequencer you are using.

This   ^^^^^^^ is no problem. The error occurs if you use
the wavetable synthesizer of the Audigy2 card.

Als already stated: I'd use TiMidity instead. But

I'd use FluidSynth instead. But is creates envelops for
strings as this were a xylophon (or so ...)

is now an MP3 file (594K)

The gaps appear after:

   12, 39, 43 and 47 seconds.

I used pmidi. But this does not matter. Yiu can use kmid or

I still don't quite understand what you mean by this.  What is the

I routinely use Fluidsynth with strings and haven't noticed any 
particular problems, except that most freely available soundfonts 
have rather too obvious short loops for their string samples.  Is it 
something particular to the soundfont you're using?

And this causes audible glitches in it's playback for you ?

Excellent, thanks... any chance of the FluidSynth string
envelope problem and dropouts from Timidity in mp3 format too :)


Wow, yes, very obvious. Enough to make composing unbearable.


Well if it doesn't happen with Timidity in alsaseq mode and,
as you point out being across many apps, then it must obviously
be something to do with the emu10k1 driver. Perhaps there might
be some buffer fragments and buffer size adjustments but I'm
not sure what values to suggest (if possible at all).

So a strong attack, then fading away rapidly to almost nothing?

I haven't got that soundfont, so I can't compare here.  Certainly with 
the soundfonts I do have, Fluidsynth produces a long level string 
tone when I play a long note.  The fonts I'm using probably just 
contain fairly straightforward sample loops.

You could always just try another soundfont, although one supplied 
with a card is probably more likely to be consistent and well 
balanced.  Still, the one I use most (Musica Theory 2) has pretty 
adequate solo strings.  I think I got it from Hammersound.

You'll find 3 files:

   - strings_hardware.mp3 (67K)
   - strings_timidity.mp3 (121K)
   - strings_fluid.mp3 (71K)

produced by hardware midi synthesizer, TiMidity++, and
FluidSynth. It is the same midi and the same
soundfont (8mbgmsfx.sf2).

In contrast to TiMidity++ and the hardware midi synthesizer
FluidSynth produces a clear attack.

Inside a big orchestra this leads to inaudible strings.
Or - if you increase the volume - to "attacking" strings.

-->><<--__-->><<--

Hmm, yes.  The difference is pretty obvious there.

Is that the string ensemble patch?  I do find that one has quite a bit 
of attack; I thought you were referring to the solo strings, which 
have some attack as well but not so much as to make one suspect the 
code rather than the whim of the soundfont designer.

I made my own comparative mp3s, but then I discovered they were 
actually playing at different pitches from yours and not in an 
obvious 44.1:48KHz ratio either.  So now I'm all confused and have to 
go and find my tuning fork.


Chris




-->><<--__-->><<--

Totally cool to be able to hear what you are talking about.

Are you sure they are all meant to be the same pitch ? The
fluidsynth notes seem to be almost a semi-tone too high. I've
got all 3 in a loop in xmms and the pitch difference is really
obvious... perhaps there's some simple off-by-one value in
there somewhere and perhaps it's effecting both the envelope
and pitch change.

There is also a stereo-ish pan and nicer delay to the timidity
sample so I suspect you did not use -EFreverb=0 -EFchorus=0 etc.

--markc




-->><<--__-->><<--

Oh yes!  No wonder I couldn't get my own version to match up.

Here's the same thing using first the violin patch and then the 
"tremolo strings" (string ensemble) patch of Musica Theory 2
in Fluidsynth:

 http://www.all-day-breakfast.com/rosegarden/tmp/violins.mp3
 http://www.all-day-breakfast.com/rosegarden/tmp/strings.mp3

As you hear, they both have some attack but the second is far more 
pronounced.  The first is the patch that I originally thought the 
discussion was about.


Chris




-->><<--__-->><<--

I've heard that some of the 1010LT's capabilities are not supported
by ALSA, but I haven't yet found one.  The breakout box with balanced
connectors and converters is a pretty big advantage.  Several times
I've wished I'd opted for it just for that reason.  However that
would've required me to get an external preamp as well.

For what you're describing, the 1010LT should work.  I don't make
full use of the MIDI features.  I plug my keyboard controller in and
it works.  I'm not sure if MIDI out works, but I suspect it does.  If
you find yourself wanting to go to a more professional quality setup,
the balanced connectors on the 1010 breakout box will be needed, so
I'd go ahead and spend the extra money up front if you have it.  It's
cheaper than trying to upgrade later.

Greg





-->><<--__-->><<--

This would be an ugly workaround, but could you (using your example) force 
TiMidity to load the sound at the beginning by putting in a clarinet note 
with velocity 0?

Jumping into the middle of a threas...here goes...

For what it's worth, I am using a 1010LT. This works fine with alsa (RH
8.0, planet CCRMA). MIDI out works fine (at least to my Alesis drum
machine). I have not tried the MIDI in, nor have I tried a MIDI
keyboard. Two XLR inputs suit my home recording needs fine, but it
shouldn't be a problem to hook up an external mixer to the RCA inputs,
right?

Hi!
  I think the timjidity config file has an option for preloading sounds. I
will look it up at home. But if you can download a new timidity++ 2.12 or
2.11, then there is an example configfile called sndfont.cfg. In this file
the soundfont options are explained.
  Best regards
         Julien

Hi there,

A colleague of mine is having major problems using multiple (three) RME
Hammerfall cards using Mac OS 9 and X and consulted me for help. 

The problem is that he has to transfer a few hours of 72-channel music
(recorded with Mackie HDR's) to his harddisk for further mixing and
processing.

I only have experience with (single and dual) stereo cards using alsa,
jack, ardour and ladspa. I wonder if anybody have experience with
multiple RME cards using alsa, and particullary experience doing such a
task with mentioned tools? 

I haven't had the chance to examine his (Mac-related) problem but it
sounds like he might suffering from problems related to his
power-supply?

Regards,
Ronald van Engelen

MidiComp is a program to manipulate SMF (Standard MIDI File) files and 
will both read and write SMF files in 0 or format 1 and also read and 
write it's own plain text format. This means a SMF file can be turned 
into easily parseble text, edited with any text editor or filtered 
through any script language, and "recompiled" back into a binary SMF
file. The package can be downloaded from...

Hi all!
  Does anyone have practical experience with installing festival? I tried it
earlier, but it didn't work out.
  First some info on my system:
  suse linux 8.2
  kernel: 2.4.19
  gcc3.2 (or 3.1)
  The usual libraries

  So then: What do I need to install the festival synthesizer, festvox-voices
and a tts
system? Can I use some mbrola tts-tool?
  I'd like to install festival from the sources. If this is advisable and
realiseable without dificulties.
  Kindest regards and thanks for any help
           Julien

At the end of this email I've included the Timidity Mailing List 
address. I am pretty sure Timidity will pre-load instruments but I don't 
remember how.


If you're referring to converting a midi file to WAV, Timidity does 
this. In fact (I beleive) that is one of it's purposes when it was 
developed. I have done it many times in the past. In fact, You can 
convert a whole directory of .mid to .wav.

If You configure everything right, Timidiy sounds _great_ and works well 
with MuSE. And that's good because MuSE allows sycronizing of (live) 
audio and midi. I'm going to download the newest version of MuSE. I'm 
not sure if it has added (recording) of live audio yet. But even with My 
old version of MuSE, I've been able to sycronize (live) audio with midi.

There's probly going to be some people on this list that will not like 
to hear this, but with the (above) combination, I was able to avoid all 
complexities of Jack. I eliminated some major steps to syncronizing midi 
and audio. For Me it's just a more stripped down way to get things done.

I've been away on a long vacation and this is My first day back, so I 
don't recall how to do any of the above (by memory). Here's the Timidity 
Mailing List...

================================================
(I don't remember if You have to "sign up" to post,
but here's the welcome message I received when I
joined...)

Please adderess all mail to the list as follows.

Keep in mind that Timidity is also a Windows program. So there are (very 
minor) differences when a Windows Person is answering Your question.

Hi,

After rereading my message, I saw too many unclarities and typos, so
I'll try again.

The problem is that we have to transfer a few hours of 72-channel music
from three synced Mackie SDR24/96's to a harddisk. I don't really know 
what format the music is recorded in.

As my colleague is unable to use three RME Hammerfall DSP card's in his
dual G4 powermac with OSX (don't know exact version), I wondered if I
could use Linux to capture the music to harddisk.

If anybody has any experience, please let me know. Otherwise we will
proceed with one card and thus 24 channels at a time, which does work.

Thanks,
Ronald van Engelen

Please see Chris's comments about much more robust midi sequencing in the 
latest release for Rosegarden.  Apparently my problems with dropped notes
with EXTERNAL synths DO have something to do with sequencers, just as I
thought.



In this posting, assuming that I found the correct place --- had to go
there indirectly --- there is no mention of the cause of the problem.  The
description "well know(n)" appears to be overstatement.  The testing 
conditions were not specified, etc.  So there is no way for any reader
to conclude that this is due to drivers rather than sequencer.

Again,  I have never had a problem with pmidi and external synths.  No
pitch-bending drops, etc., even though they do occur with very intense MIDI
under Windows, Rosegarden, and Muse.  pmidi with external synths and emu10k1
drivers with SB Live! Value have never had a problem --- not once.

So I find the emu10k1 drivers to be fine for me so far.

Chris,

Thank you!  I look forward to more robust MIDI sequencing!

Hi all!
  I've been trying to stretch a soundfile. It is a piano track with mostly two
voices only. I did it with an fft plain phase vocoder. Now there are a lot of
parameters and I got some undesireable delay. In general the stretched sound
was good, but the delay is disturbing. So here's the question, how should I
set the following parameters to get the best result?
  fft-length (as high as possible?), windows per second, window length,
windowtype (hamming, triangular, kasier with several coeffecients).
  Any ideas or practical experience with that? - I'm NOT doing it in realtime,
so CPU-time is no problem. I've got time! :-)
  Thanbks for any help or good ideas!
  Kindest regards
          Julien

Hi,

I can't help you much, however, unless JACK has
recently been worked on I think there's a 32 track
limitation. It's known to be technically trivial.
Otherwise I don't believe alsa would be a problem,
assuming you've got wordclock i/o on the hammerfall
cards. 

Midi Time Code syncronization in Ardour could also be
problematic, it doesn't work with my Tascam DM-24.
Even though transport location is accurate, the
automation system can't interpret Ardour mtc. Paul has
announced his intention to implement SMPTE but I'm not
sure if that's been done yet.

I wonder what the status of 96kHz adat is with the
hammerfall drivers.

Anyway, that's not much help. Sorry.

ron






-->><<--__-->><<--

Hi, if you have short echoes that annoy you, you should decrease
the window length. For your relatively simple spectra and
relatively fast dynamics (piano attacks) I would guess that
1024 or perhaps 2048 should be good, and similar for fft length.
*Not* as high as possible!

Window type doesn't matter much - I usually use Hanning (not Hamming).

I don't know what program you are using, but I assume that "windows per
second" has to do with overlap. If you do very long stretches, you might
like to increase this value, but otherwise it shouldn't matter much.

I have forwarded this to alsa-devel as there is probably more luck 
finding the answer here and it would be a valuable thread to have as a 
resource.

i second that opinion (not that it matters much, i'm no dsp expert..).



here i disagree. triangular would be inconvenient, as well as kaiser with=
 a
low coefficient (approaching a rectangular window). i'd try something
between 0.35 and 0.6 to start.



those are good bets, as well as blackmann windows, which i usually prefer
for certain applications.=20

OK, you are right - triangular doesn't add up to unit power
gain over the window crossfade period so could possibly
give a modulation effect. Hm, how can I save face - let's
say I meant that it doesn't matter much for the echo problem
:-)


oh.



-->><<--__-->><<--

still in place at this time. there is a simple 1-2 line solution; i'm
not sure if its the right one, since it simply substitutes a 64
channel limit.


yes, to repeat a familiar refrain these days, being an MTC master
on an unpatched linux system is, to the best of my knowledge,
fundamentally impossible. your other systems will chase the linux
master, but will not lock to it.


for the hdsp, its know to work fine. the digi9652 works, but it may
require some work to configure the device properly. sorry i don't
remember more (and i'm the author .. :)


i personally think you will have a much easier time doing it one card
at a time. there is nothing about ALSA that will stop you from trying
this, assuming as ron noted that you wordclock-sync all 3 cards. but
you will also be streaming a large amount of data to disk (on the
order of 13MB/sec at 48kHz, twice that at 96kHz), and you will need a
pretty robust disk subsystem to manage this flawlessly.
